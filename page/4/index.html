            <h1><a href="/blog/2019/05/22/exceptional-exceptions">Exceptional Exceptions</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>You've made it to this post thinking "Why do we still need to talk about Exceptions?". Well, they're used everywhere in OOP codebases, but sometimes they're used in a way that make debugging a bit difficult. Let's look at some ways to make debugging exceptions a bit more fun!</p>

<p>You know that feeling when you're trying to investigate an Exception that was thrown, but you can't seem to find the origin of it? You dig a bit deeper and you find that it's an exception that was caught and not rethrown, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code class="php">try {
    $this-&gt;doSomeImportantStuffWith($foo);
} catch (VeryDescriptiveException $e) {
    // do some stuff here

    throw new SomethingWentWrongException('oh no!');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when you encounter this <code>SomethingWentWrongException</code>, you'll see that the trace takes you back to the 6th line of this code example. All information that was inside the <code>VeryDescriptiveException</code>, including its message, stack trace and other useful information is gone. Of course, debugging that error in <code>doSomeImportantStuffWith()</code> would be much easier if you had all that info.</p>

<pre><code class="php">Fatal error: Uncaught SomethingWentWrongException: oh no! in test.php:6
Stack trace:
#0 /Users/toon/Projects/devblog/test.php(34): Test-&gt;withoutPrevious()
#1 {main}
  thrown in /Users/toon/Projects/devblog/test.php on line 6
</code></pre>

<h2 id="prevent-information-loss-by-using-%60%24previous%60">Prevent information loss by using <code>$previous</code></h2>

<p>The obvious answer to this simplified example would be to just rethrow the <code>VeryDescriptiveException</code> instead of throwing a more general <code>SomethingWentWrongException</code>... And that would be valid, but let's say we're implementing an Interface that prescribes that we only throw <code>SomethingWentWrongException</code>s. We can't let the <code>VeryDescriptiveException</code> through or we'll break the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</a>. We want to throw that specific <code>SomethingWentWrongException</code>, while still somehow preserving the information of that previous exception that we caught. Let's check <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/exception.construct.php">the docs</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-05-24-exceptional-exceptions/php-docs-exception-construct.png" alt="PHP Docs for the Exception Constructor" /></p>

<p>That <code>Throwable $previous = null</code> is what we're looking for! I've almost never seen this being used in the wild, but it's great for our usecase:</p>

<pre><code class="php">try {
    $this-&gt;doSomeImportantStuffWith($foo);
} catch (VeryDescriptiveException $e) {
    // do some stuff here

    throw new SomethingWentWrongException('oh no!', 0, $e);
}
</code></pre>

<p>this results in this error:</p>

<pre><code class="php">Fatal error: Uncaught VeryDescriptiveException: hello there! in test.php:15
Stack trace:
#0 /Users/toon/Projects/devblog/test.php(23): Test-&gt;doSomeImportantStuffWith('test')
#1 /Users/toon/Projects/devblog/test.php(34): Test-&gt;withPrevious()
#2 {main}

Next SomethingWentWrongException: oh no! in test.php:6
Stack trace:
#0 /Users/toon/Projects/devblog/test.php(34): Test-&gt;withPrevious()
#1 {main}
  thrown in /Users/toon/Projects/devblog/test.php on line 6
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the stack trace of the original exception along with the one we wrapped it in are presented to us on error! We can see the message as well, and we can even add our own properties to the exception and be presented with them here if we just implement the <code>__toString()</code> method of the exception.</p>

<h2 id="custom-properties-in-exceptions">Custom properties in exceptions</h2>

<p>Let's say we've been building an API client that does some HTTP requests to an endpoint. Something can go wrong during the HTTP request, and we want to thrown an <code>ApiConnectionFailed</code> exception whenever the HTTP response code is not <code>2xx</code> or something else fails, so that the rest of our application has one single Exception it needs to prepare for. It would be very handy to debug if that exception contained our HTTP Request &amp; Response objects, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class ApiConnectionFailed extends Exception
{
    private $request;
    private $response;

    public static function withHttpRequestAndResponse(
        $message,
        Request $request = null,
        Response $response = null,
        Throwable $previous = null
    ) {
        $exception = new static($message, 0, $previous);
        $exception-&gt;request = $request;
        $exception-&gt;response = $response;

        return $exception;
    }

    public function __toString()
    {
        $string = parent::__toString();
        $string .= "\n{$this-&gt;request}";
        $string .= "\n{$this-&gt;response}";

        return $string;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we used a <a href="http://verraes.net/2014/06/named-constructors-in-php/">named constructor</a> <code>withHttpRequestAndResponse</code> to be able to keep the default constructor for Exceptions, but to also be able to construct it using a lot of extra relevant debugging information. This means that this Exception behaves like other exceptions and is very transparent to other developers.</p>

<p>If something fails, we'll construct the exception like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">try {
    $response = $httpClient-&gt;execute($request);
} catch (HttpClientException $e) {
    throw ApiConnectionFailed::withHttpRequestAndResponse(
        'Http connection could not be established',
        $request,
        null,
        $e
    );
}

if ($response-&gt;getResponseCode() === 500) {
    throw ApiConnectionFailed::withHttpRequestAndResponse(
        'We got a 500 error from the host',
        $request,
        $response
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The exception will always contain all relevant information to be able to debug.</p>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

<p>To quickly recap, you can make your life a lot easier by</p>

<ul>
<li>providing exceptions with descriptive names</li>
<li>providing the <code>$previous</code> exception when rethrowing</li>
<li>providing all relevant data to an exception</li>
<li>providing named constructors for your exceptions to be able to add debugging info but keep the original constructor</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope that helps! Until next time, have fun coding! 🖖</p>

            <p><strong>This is the sixth post in a series about using Functional Programming concepts to make your Object Oriented code more comprehensible. Start <a href="/blog/2018/03/02/lambda-lists-to-wrap-failure">here</a> if you want to read the whole thing.</strong></p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%A4%94-how-do-you-hide-your-internals%3F">🤔 How do you hide your internals?</h2>

<p>In OOP, we're used to hiding the implementation details of our classes by using interfaces. We can just define a contract that the rest of the application needs to adhere to, and keep the knowledge of the internals completely separate from the rest of the system. Let's look at a simple interface:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace Dns;

interface Client
{
    public function resolve(Request $request): Response;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As a consumer of this interface, we actually know everything we need to know to start programming. We'll inject the class we're making with a <code>DNS\Client</code> instance later, the actual implementation of it doesn't concern us right now. We have enough information to create our application knowing that we can send the client a <code>Request</code> and get a <code>Response</code> back. The internals of the <code>Dns\Client</code> can be changed at will, without altering our program.</p>

<p>For me, this was the biggest breakthrough of learning an Object Oriented language, the moment when using interfaces as contracts clicked. That's why, when I started to dive into Functional Programming languages, I wasn't really happy with what I saw. Where were the interfaces at?</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%98%85-exporting-from-modules-as-interface">😅 Exporting from modules as interface</h2>

<p>The first Functional Programming language I learnt was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>. It was great! When you start learning it, you start to see the recursion patterns, see that syntax is only so important as the language makes it, and countless other nice things (programming with continuations, anyone?). What bothered me was that lists are used as the main data structure everywhere! You'll sometimes find libraries that do something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">(define address
  (list "Toon Daelman" "FooBarStreet 42" "9000 Ghent" "Belgium"))
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, that's a workable data structure, but it's not ideal... To get a person's country from their address, you need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">(list-ref address 3)
</code></pre>

<p>Which means, from the <code>address</code> list, take the <code>3rd</code> (zero-based) index. That's not very readable at all, and it doesn't hide any of the details of our data structure. If we want to change it, every function interacting with this data structure will need to change as well.</p>

<p>Luckily, the problem was me. I didn't look far enough, and most people working with lisps have other ways of hiding their internals, for instance:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">(module address (address country)
  (import scheme)

  (define address
    (lambda (name line1 line2 country)
      (list name line1 line2 country)))

  (define country
    (lambda (address)
      (list-ref address 3)))
)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a scheme module, that exports two functions <code>address</code> and <code>country</code>. It uses the base library <code>scheme</code>. It defines a function <code>address</code>, that acts like a constructor and returns a black box object, that you can deconstruct using separate functions. In this case we only have a <code>country</code> function that takes an <code>address</code> and returns its <code>country</code>. Consuming modules of this <code>address</code> module need only now the constructor and the other functions, not that the underlying object is still a list!</p>

<p>And this lets us change the implementation as well!</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">(module address (address country)
  (import scheme)

  (define address
    (lambda (name line1 line2 country)
      (vector name line1 line2 country)))

  (define country
    (lambda (address)
      (vector-ref address 3)))
)
</code></pre>

<p>We're now using <code>vector</code>s as the datatype for <code>address</code> instead of <code>list</code>s, but the <code>address</code> constructor and the <code>country</code> getter function are still called the same and behave exactly the same. We could use the records features as well, still keeping the same public interface...</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%8E%A9-types">🎩 Types</h2>

<p>The second Functional Programming language I started to look into was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">Haskell</a>. It immediately blew my mind with its type system. Let's check out this piece of code:</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">type AddressLine = String
type Country = String

data Address = Address
  { name :: String
  , line1 :: AddressLine
  , line2 :: AddressLine
  , country :: Country
  } deriving (Show)

countryFrom :: Address -&gt; Country
countryFrom = country
</code></pre>

<p>We define two type aliasses <code>AddressLine</code> and <code>Country</code>. Then we say that an <code>Address</code> consists of a <code>name</code>, a <code>line1</code> which is an <code>AddressLine</code>, a <code>line2</code> (also an <code>AddressLine</code>) and a <code>country</code> of the type <code>Country</code>. Then we define a function called <code>countryFrom</code> that takes an <code>Address</code> and returns a <code>Country</code>, which is implemented by just saying it's equal to <code>country</code>, the function that is automatically created to unwrap <code>Record</code>s.</p>

<p>In fact, creating the <code>countryFrom</code> function was just done as an example to show off the type annotations in a situation analogous to the previous example in scheme. The type system in Haskell allows us to not only write the contract of a function, but it allows us to write abstractions as well! Check this out:</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">head :: [a] -&gt; a
</code></pre>

<p>This is the type of the <code>head</code> function, which operates on lists. It takes a list of <code>a</code>s and returns an <code>a</code>. The <code>a</code> is a <em>type variable</em>, it substitutes for every type you can think of. This way, you can strictly type a function that can work with all sorts of types! Take for instance a list of <code>Address</code>es! Call <code>head</code> on that list, and you'll get the first <code>Address</code> of the list.</p>

<p>🎩➡️🐰</p>

<p>😍 I love this, it's like magic! And it goes even further. Let's say you want to be able to declare the function <code>==</code> which takes two arguments and checks if they're equal to each other. You would think that that would be easy using <em>type variables</em>, doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">(==) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
</code></pre>

<p>Which means, a function <code>==</code> which takes two arguments of the same type (we use <code>a</code> for both arguments, which means we don't care which type it is, but it should be the same for both arguments) and returns a <code>Bool</code>. The problem is that there's no certainty that the type <code>a</code> has a concept of equality to it. It could be that we want to be able to define our own rules for equality on a type-by-type basis as well... That's why that signature <code>a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code> isn't enough.</p>

<p>Haskell actually has another abstraction over their types to allow us to put the <code>a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code> in a context:</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
  x == y = not (x /= y)

  (/=) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
  x /= y = not (x == y)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a typeclass named <code>Eq</code> that defines equality for every type <code>a</code> that we say is part of the typeclass. It defines two functions, <code>==</code> and <code>/=</code>, which both take two arguments of the type <code>a</code> and return a <code>Bool</code>. What's also nice, is that they're both defined in terms of each other. <code>==</code> says that it's <code>not (/=)</code> and vice versa.</p>

<p>Now, if we want to make our <code>Address</code> type part of the typeclass <code>Eq</code>, we can just implement the <code>==</code> function, and we get the other one for free because it's defined in terms of <code>==</code>. Let's look at an example:</p>

<pre><code class="haskell">instance Eq Address where
  x == y = sameAddressLines &amp;&amp; sameCountry
    where sameAddressLines = (line1 x == line1 y) &amp;&amp; (line2 x == line2 y)
          sameCountry = country x == country y
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, we say <code>Address</code>es are the same if their <code>AddressLine</code>s and <code>Country</code> are the same. We don't take <code>name</code> into consideration. Now we can <code>==</code> on <code>Address</code>es everywhere. If you don't need special rules for deriving equality for a given type, the Haskell compiler can derive it for your type using the <code>deriving (Eq)</code> statement.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%A4%93-what-can-we-learn-from-this%3F">🤓 What can we learn from this?</h2>

<p>We've seen two ways of how implementation details can be hidden in a functional programming environment. When we're in Object Oriented environments we do almost the same things, but we use interfaces for them. And we use interfaces to describe contracts for many other things we want to do. That's why I'm sometimes confused when I stumble upon an interface: what's the primary reason for it to be here? Is it there to define a contract for external systems? Is it meant to hide implementation details or is it just part of a design pattern used in this package? Is it a marking interface used to indicate the type of the implementing class? Not every class needs to be implementing an interface... It already has one! All public methods of a concrete class can be seen as its public interface. And I think in most cases like the first example in scheme where we want to hide the internals of a datatype, a concrete class can be enough (think <code>ValueObject</code>s).</p>

<p>I find that in Object Oriented Programming, thinking about types as you do when writing e.g. Haskell, tends to help when defining your interfaces effectively. One of the biggest differences is the manifestation of side-effects: In Haskell, there's a type for functions with side effects, while interfaces in Object Oriented languages mostly don't give you any insights into that (I've often thought about annotating side-effects in the docblocks of my interfaces).</p>

<p>While PHP doesn't allow you to implement your own Equality rules for your classes, some Object Oriented languages do. Compare these examples:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$foo == $bar;
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="php">$foo-&gt;equals($bar);
</code></pre>

<p>In the first example, we can't influence how PHP compares two instances of our class, while in the second one, we have complete control (even over the name of the method). It depends on taste what's best, certainly when your language allows you to overload <code>==</code> for your classes. Always try to make it as readable as possible!</p>

<p>Wow, we made it through! Hope to see you in the next episode! Happy programming y'aλλ! 🖖</p>

            <p>As a team, we consume A LOT of blog posts, YouTube videos, podcasts, and tweets about software development and related topics each year. Like <a href="/blog/2017/12/22/our-favorite-content-of-2017">last year</a>, we asked everyone in the team to share their favorite stuff that they found online, so that you can read it too. Here we go!</p>

<p>Jurriaan liked this blog post. We're developers, software engineers, programmers. We're not only specialized in a framework! What we study is the way of solving problems, and frameworks are merely tools for our craft. This is valuable advice that has been given to us over the years, and people new to development tend to forget.</p>

<h3 id="the-end-of-silex"><a href="https://symfony.com/blog/the-end-of-silex">The End Of Silex</a></h3>

<p>We're sad to see our favorite "framework as a library" go, but it's safe to say that it served its purpose incredibly well. Thanks Silex!</p>

<h3 id="tailwind-css"><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a></h3>

<p>Tailwind CSS has been hot news in the frontend community, which is why Thomas wanted to share this link. A new CSS Framework? Again? Yes, and this time, the design principles used are a little different than before. Check it out!</p>

            <p>Are you a student looking for an internship for 2017-2018? We have a fun project for you...</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-do%3F">What do we do?</h2>

<p>The Clarabridge CX Social team builds a customer care tool for social media. Our clients use our software to be able to respond to the incoming questions and complaints on their Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, Instagram profiles, a.o. These clients often have a high volume of messages, on several social profiles. We try to make those people’s lives easier by offering automation tools, smart routing of messages and reply suggestions, among others.<br />
<a href="https://developers.engagor.com/team">Read more about what we do</a>.</p>

<p>As of September 2017, we have room for one or more enthusiastic interns to join us for (at least) a couple of weeks <em>(preferably 4 days a week, any time between September 2017 to June 2018)</em>, to work as part of the CX Social development team. As an intern you are an integral part of the R&amp;D team working on different parts of the application using technologies like PHP, React, MySQL, Redis, memcached, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, a.o. The other team members include a designer, front-end developer, data scientist, and several system engineers &amp; full-stack web developers.<br />
We are looking for a student with interest and knowledge of both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>

<p>Want to hear from a previous intern what it’s like to join our team? Read about <a href="https://engagor.github.io/blog/2017/06/01/internship-gheerwijn-cx-social-developer/">Gheerwijn’s experiences</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-project%3A-achievements%21">The Project: Achievements!</h2>

<p>A big percentage of users work in our customer care tool full time, day-in day-out. So it’s important for us to keep the user experience for them smooth and enjoyable. We want to make the experience more fun by developing an achievement based system in the web-application.</p>

<p>Apart from making CX Social more fun for agents to work in, we aim to improve team work, increase retention and let users discover new features.</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/06/15/vim-ide-refactoring">Vim As A PHP IDE - Refactoring</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p><strong>This blogpost is part of the "Vim As A PHP IDE" series, which starts <a href="/blog/2017/01/01/vim-ide-setting-up">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I kept the best for last. The feature I get the most questions about is the refactoring capabilities of IDEs. While Vim has some great features that most IDEs don't have, it certainly is true that this is one of the features that Vim is not really that good at. Or is it? In any case, it's good enough at it for me. Let's see what we got.</p>

<h2 id="how-would-you-do-it-from-the-cli%3F">How would you do it from the cli?</h2>

<p>Basically, if some functionality is not in Vim by default, there are two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a command line tool that already does the job - this is how Vim fits into the UNIX philosophy.</li>
<li>Use Vimscript to program the functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily, there's this neat tool called <a href="https://github.com/QafooLabs/php-refactoring-browser/">PHP Refactoring Browser</a>, that already knows how to do some PHP refactorings from the command line.</p>

<ul>
<li>extract method;</li>
<li>rename local variable;</li>
<li>local variable to instance variable;</li>
<li>optimise use statements;</li>
</ul>

<p>The tool is also open source, so we can add missing refactorings in the future. The tool is standing on the shoulders of giants like <a href="https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser">PHP Parser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Andrewsville/PHP-Token-Reflection">PHP Token Reflection</a>. But doing this from the command line isn't that great...</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/refactoring-browser.png" alt="Running the Refactoring Browser from the command line" /></p>

<h2 id="vim-integration">Vim integration</h2>

<p>Of course, some people already thought this was useful for Vim people, and created <a href="https://github.com/vim-php/vim-php-refactoring">a plugin</a> to wrap the command line tool. I'm assuming you installed the command line tool in <code>/usr/local/bin/refactor.phar</code>. Install the plugin using your favorite Vim package manager, and put this line in your <code>.vimrc</code> to let the plugin know where to look for the executable:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">" PHP refactoring browser
let g:php_refactor_command='/usr/local/bin/refactor.phar'
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/refactoring-in-vim.png" alt="Running the Refactoring Browser from within Vim" /></p>

<p>You can now do these basic refactorings using their hotkey <code>&lt;Leader&gt;r</code> and selecting your desired refactoring from the list. That's nice, but there are some refactorings missing that we'd like, e.g. "Extract Interface".</p>

<h2 id="creating-refactorings-with-vimscript">Creating refactorings with Vimscript</h2>

<p>While the best solution would definitely be to contribute to the PHP Refactoring Browser, we want to have this functionality right now. Let's create the "Extract Interface" refactoring in Vimscript. I'd like to select some class methods using linewise <code>VISUAL</code> mode, issue a command on it, fill in the name of the Interface that I'd like the methods be extracted to, and have the current class implement that method. Let's see what we got:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">command! -range PhpExtractInterfaceFromRange &lt;line1&gt;,&lt;line2&gt;call PhpInterfaceFromRange()

function! PhpInterfaceFromRange() range
  let interface = input('Enter extracted interface name: ')
  call PhpExtractInterface(a:firstline, a:lastline, interface)
endfunction

function! PhpExtractInterface(start, end, interface)
  normal! qkq
  execute ''.a:start.','.a:end.'g/public.*function.*(\_.\{-})/normal ^f(V%"Ky'
  let @k = substitute(@k, ' \?{', '', 'g')
  let @k = substitute(@k, ')', ');', 'g')
  ?class
  execute "normal! A implements ".a:interface
  execute "normal! Ointerface ".a:interface
  execute "normal! o{\&lt;CR&gt;}\&lt;CR&gt;"
  normal! k"kP
  normal! dd
endfunction
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>We create a command, called <code>PhpExtractInterfaceFromRange</code> which can be called with a Vim range (like <code>10,50</code>, or from a <code>VISUAL</code> select). If the command is issued, it calls a Vimscript function with the name <code>PhpInterfaceFromRange()</code></li>
<li>The <code>PhpInterfaceFromRange()</code> function asks the user how they want to call their new interface, and passes the range and the name of that interface to <code>PhpExtractInterface()</code></li>
<li>Here's where the real magic happens. We clear register <code>k</code>, and search for all public method definitions in the specified range. We then append every definition to the <code>k</code> register. We then remove curly braces <code>{}</code> and put the missing <code>;</code> after every method definition. We search for the start of the current class, and make it implement the interface. We then create the interface with the contents of the register <code>k</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/extract-interface-1.png" alt="Extracting an interface from a class with one method selected in Visual Mode" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/extract-interface-2.png" alt="Interface was extracted successfully" /></p>

<p><strong>Wow</strong></p>

<p>Since this is now a command, it could easily be assigned a <code>&lt;Leader&gt;</code> hotkey for visual mode selects, for instance. And you could easily do the same thing for e.g. "Extract Class".</p>

<p>Now, I created this in half an hour, and it's perfectly usable in most use cases, but it's not perfect. As this is the only refactoring I really missed from the Refactoring Browser, I'll just use this until a real refactoring gets integrated in the real plugin. There are plugins with some more Vimscript implementations of refactorings, like <a href="https://github.com/adoy/vim-php-refactoring-toolbox">this one</a>. Keep in mind that they will be susceptible to mistakes, as they don't <em>really</em> understand your PHP code like the Refactoring Browser does.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>So, that's it for this episode, and for now this will also be the end of this blog series for now. I hope you liked it! Happy Vimming!</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/06/01/internship-gheerwijn-cx-social-developer">What it&#039;s Like to Intern at CX Social</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>This February, Gheerwijn joined the CX Social development team as an intern. Now, three months later, with the bulk of his internship over, we’ve asked him what that was like and what he built.</p>

<h3 id="building-a-social-profile-manager">Building a Social Profile Manager</h3>

<p>The idea for the subject of the internship started a few years ago when several of our customers, including the <a href="https://twitter.com/nmbs">Belgian Railways NMBS</a>, started showing off their Twitter reply times in their cover photo. NMBS took the reply time for their Twitter profile from the CX Social API and wrote the necessary code to showcase that on their page.</p>

<p><center>
<img src="/images/2017-06-01-profile-manager-internship-gheerwijn/nmbs.png" alt="NMBS Twitter Profile" /><br />
<small>NMBS Twitter Profile</small>
</center></p>

<p>We thought it would be great to build this into CX Social itself and improve on the idea with the extra features our tool offers, like having different cover images depending on your business hours, or showing different avatars depending on if a certain crisis plan is active. 
Gheerwijn, a student of <a href="https://www.odisee.be/nl/elektronica-ict">Electronica - ICT at Odisee Gent</a>, took on this challenge and dove right in.</p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn</strong>: <em>"The main purpose of the Profile Manager is to give CX Social customers a single place to manage all of their owned social profiles. Not only can it manage basic profile information, but it can also perform more complex tasks. The most striking feature of the Profile Manager is the ability to create themes. These themes are a combination of a profile photo and cover photo."</em></p>

<p>The idea was to offer clients the possibility to upload their own pictures and even annotate them. These annotations include plain text, but also variables like "reply time" or "unique users serviced".</p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"After a theme has been created, it can be scheduled for one or more profiles. This means that CX Social users can choose when a specific theme, like a Christmas theme, should be shown on certain profiles. We've also added the option to show different themes during/outside configured business hours schedules."</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>"This feature gives companies with a large customer base on social the ability to be transparant on how long it will approximately take to get an answer to their questions."</em></strong> - Gheerwijn</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="using-react-and-node.js">Using React and Node.js</h3>

<p>When asked about what were some of the most interesting aspects of the project, Gheerwijn cites the JavaScript library React and the backend technology Node.js as two fun technologies to work with.</p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"I had heard of React but never actually used it. A first experiment I did with it was a component to handle the scheduling of a theme. It proved to be an excellent way to quickly create interactive user interfaces, so I started to use it for everything I possibly could."</em></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"I also got to work on a Node.js microservice. Although I had already worked with Node.js on several occasions, I got to use new modules and libraries, like Fabric, which made it an interesting learning opportunity. I love how Node.js brings the joy of writing JavaScript to the backend.
The hardest part to get right was having the annoted images render correctly, both on the front-end as well as in the back-end."</em></p>

</center></p>

<p><strong>CX Social: Did you acquire any non-technical skills while working here?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn</strong>: <em>"Preparing for the weekly status meetings was a great way to learn how to separate the important things from the less important ones. It forced me to spend more time thinking about how the users would eventually use this feature. I learned that things that are obvious to the programmer aren't necessarily clear to the users."</em></p>

<h3 id="a-look-behind-the-scenes">A Look Behind the Scenes</h3>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"What drew me to this internship proposal was the fact that it involved social media. Everyone and their mother has a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram account. Not only individuals, but also companies are using social media on a daily basis. In this day and age, social media is something irreplaceable.
I started at CX Social because I wanted a look behind the scenes."</em></p>

<p><strong>CX Social:</strong> <strong>Did you have any idea what to expect that first day you started?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>I actually expected it to be quite stressful, mainly because it was such a big project to complete, but also because you suddenly start working in a company and you have to get to know everything and everyone.</em></p>

<p><strong>CX Social:</strong> <strong>So, how high were the stress levels then?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"Well, the team was very helpful. I felt like a real part of the team and not just ‘the intern’.
Anthony helped me out with getting to know the do's and don'ts in the codebase. Hans introduced me to several best practices and ways to make my code better. Down the road, I got to work with Jared and Ursula, who both took care of the design. Jurriaan was always able to come up with a solution to problems I would've never been able to fix on my own. And Toon showed me how to integrate my features in the task-scheduling back-end of CX Social. In the end, I got to work with everyone from the development team. I learned a lot just from asking other people how they would approach a certain problem."</em></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"When I thought something didn't make sense the way it was expected to be implemented, my thoughts about what I thought should change were actually taken into account and implemented."</em></p>

<p><strong>CX Social: Any moments during your internship that stood out?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"There are two moments I won't forget. The team went on a two-day off-site bootcamp. It was the perfect way to get to know all the team members. After an entire day of working, the evenings were filled with fun activities. It was certainly not something I was expecting to do during my internship!
The second unforgettable moment was the last day of my internship. After months of working on this one feature, the time had come to deploy it to production. We spent the last days pair programming the last bits to be able to put it live for testing. It was great seeing the work I did go live to beta-testers."</em></p>

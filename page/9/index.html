            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/05/22/implementing-little-big-details-on-offsite-bootcamp">Taking Care of Little Big Details on an Off-Site Bootcamp</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>A few weeks ago, we went on a two-day off-site with the CX Social development team for an event we dubbed "improvement bootcamp". It's the second time we did something like this and since it was fun and we got quite a lot of stuff done, we wanted to share our story. Maybe it could work for your team as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-roadmaps">The problem with roadmaps</h2>

<p>The idea behind a bootcamp is "drop everything, let's work on something else, someplace else for a few days". For two days, we were hidden away in a beautiful house in the fields of Waasland where we focused solely on what we like to call "little big details".</p>

<p>Over the course of the 6+ years that our product has existed, we have built up a huge database of customer requests. Prioritization and implementation of those requests is a constant process; in fact, almost all of our roadmap is compromised of client-requested features. We take logging these requests very seriously. Feature requests come to us through our ideas forum (where clients can post &amp; up-vote ideas), via our Live Chat, and via our dedicated Customer Success team. All of this information (what is requested, who is requesting it, if it's technically possible/feasible, etc.) is then ranked by priority and, after being curated by the Product Team, makes up the roadmap.</p>

<p>That roadmap becomes our daily job, at least when we're not playing <a href="https://engagor.github.io/blog/2017/03/01/batman-chatman/">Batman</a>. We always have a detailed roadmap for the next release of our product (around three months), and a more general one for the upcoming 12 months. This balance works for us; we can commit certain projects to our customers, while on the longer term we can stay flexible, react quickly to changing customer demands, and implement new social functionality when it becomes available.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/2017-05-22-march-2017-bootcamp/doing-all-at-once.gif" alt="When we try to do all at once" /><br />
<small>When we try to do all at once</small>
</center></p>

<p>But, as it often goes, projects aren't perfectly defined from the start (their scope often grows) and we developers tend to underestimate projects, so getting everything finished on-time sometimes (more often than we’d like) results in neglecting some of the details. Those are the details that make a product stress-free, or - why not - even fun to use.</p>

<p>The "improvement bootcamp" is our initiative to force ourselves to periodically step back and focus on these little big details.</p>

<h2 id="little-big-details">Little Big Details</h2>

<p>But what do we mean with “little big details”? It can be anything from natural sorting of elements in tables, consistent design of similar pages throughout the application, to friendlier wording of messages in the application.</p>

<p>Often, they're simple things. Often, they're not real “new” features. Often, you might not even know you were missing them.</p>

<p>Have you noticed how, when using Google Maps to get directions to another place, the walking man icon changes into a person with a backpack and walking sticks? Or how Spotify congratulates you on your good taste in music when you click 'Lyrics' on a song that Spotify doesn't have lyrics for?</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/2017-05-22-march-2017-bootcamp/google-maps.png" alt="Little big detail in Google Maps" /><br />
<small>Little big detail in Google Maps</small></center></p>

<p>It's stuff like this that makes good products even more enjoyable to use.</p>

<p>For our tool, a few of the candidates we selected for the bootcamp include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A more consistent loading/empty view of widgets around the different dashboards that CX Social offers;</li>
<li>Requiring people to type the name of the topic they want to delete;</li>
<li>Remembering the text you typed in the reply bar, so that if it fails, users can easily try again;</li>
<li>Make the "click area" of widgets bigger when selecting widgets to add to a dashboard;</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these features will win awards, nor will they ever be on the top of most requested features lists; sometimes they're just small nuisances. But they do have an impact; it's details that make the difference between a good software product and one that's actually fun to use.</p>

<h2 id="the-action-plan">The action plan</h2>

<p><center><img src="/images/2017-05-22-march-2017-bootcamp/action-plan.png" alt="Spreadsheet with the action plan" /><br />
<small>Spreadsheet with the action plan</small></center></p>

<p>This was our action plan to get as much of this done, in a short timeframe, and have some fun while doing it:</p>

<ol>
<li>To start, we asked all members of the CX Social team, from Sales to Marketing, to tag improvements in our Github repository that they thought would fit the goal.</li>
<li>These were scored on a few aspects:

<ol>
<li>Priority: Indicator of how aligned the idea is with our product vision.</li>
<li>Impact: How many customers are requesting it or would benefit from it?</li>
<li>Workload: How long would it take us to implement this? (If it's expected to take longer than 4 hours, it's probably not a good candidate.)</li>
<li>Coolness: Sometimes the really fun ideas need a little bump, don't they?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The candidates were sorted according to the formula <code>(Impact * 1.5) + (Priority * 5) + (Workload * -2) + Coolness</code>. This would be the order in which we would tackle them.</li>
<li>The top 50 items in this priority list were discussed with everyone in the development team and assigned.</li>
<li>We started working on them on Wednesday morning with the goal of finishing work by Thursday evening.</li>
<li>During the coding, we kept track of our own and each other’s progress on a Github project board; indicating whenever a certain improvement was implemented, ready for review, reviewed, and ready for production.</li>
<li>On Thursday evening, we presented internally to the development team what everyone was able to accomplish.</li>
</ol>

<p><center><img src="/images/2017-05-22-march-2017-bootcamp/github-project-board.png" alt="Github Project Board" /><br />
<small>Github Project Board</small></center></p>

<h2 id="the-results">The results</h2>

<p>On Friday afternoon - our weekly beer-o'clock in the Gent office - we presented the results of the bootcamp to the whole CX Social team. In total, we were able to get 42 things done. The list included a bunch of internal improvements - thus making our support ninjas happy - and it included some longstanding customer requests.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/2017-05-22-march-2017-bootcamp/results-presentation-slide.png" alt="Slide from the presentation to the team" /><br />
<small>Slide from the presentation to the team</small></center></p>

<p>It did take a few more days to put everything from the bootcamp into production, because we still had to hand it over to QA, prepare any customer communication, and make sure the merges happened in a coordinated way.</p>

<p>If you would argue that details and fun stuff like this should be part of the standard product and development workflow, I totally agree. And while events like this might look like "patching", they actually contribute to installing that mindset by making everyone in the team aware of the importance of these.</p>

<p>A bootcamp like this has the pleasant side effect of actually proving what we as a team are able to accomplish in a short timeframe. That feeling of speed, and accompanying pride, is a bit harder to find when you're working on bigger, long-term projects that involve lots more nuts and bolts.
Working outside of your comfort zone, by working on features in the code base you haven't seen before, or more literally, by not sitting at your desk, increased team communication and trained new team members.</p>

<p>And of course, you get to learn new stuff about your colleagues after hours. Like how passionate Gheerwijn is about analog cameras.
And that's about all the info you’ll get, because: "what happens at the bootcamp, stays at the bootcamp". Let this vague Polaroid picture of the team be a little testament to that.</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/05/15/vim-ide-testing">Vim As A PHP IDE - Testing</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p><strong>This blogpost is part of the "Vim As A PHP IDE" series, which starts <a href="/blog/2017/01/01/vim-ide-setting-up">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>I used to always run my unit tests from the command line, but the integration that IDEs give is great. If something goes wrong you can immedately jump to where you need to be to fix it, and your test results remain visible in the same window you're working on. I wanted the same thing in Vim, so I started the investigation.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to use the default Vim <code>:!</code> shell command mode for that (if you want to know more, check <code>:h :!</code>). I was using <a href="http://www.phpspec.net/">phpspec</a> at that time, so I created two hotkeys, one to describe a new class, and one to run the tests. In <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">" PHP run phpspec
noremap &lt;Leader&gt;d :! bin/phpspec desc 
noremap &lt;Leader&gt;o :! bin/phpspec run&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with that approach, is that Vim doesn't know what to do with them, and just shows you the command line output they provide. I wanted more integration between my tools. After some more looking around, I found out that Vim has support to run a <code>compiler</code> command, and interpret its output with some kind of regex. You can run it using <code>:make</code> and if there are errors in the build, it collects them in a list which you can use to jump to the place you need to be to fix it. Sounds just like what I needed!</p>

<p>And yes, it turns out some other people also found that out. There's a <a href="https://github.com/afternoon/vim-phpunit">PHPUnit compiler</a>, which lets you use Vim's <code>:make</code> command with PHPUnit. Great! There also seems to be a <a href="https://github.com/renanivo/phpspec.vim">phpspec compiler</a>.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that Vim picks the right compiler for the right filetype, so you can do something similar for JavaScript files in your project, and have it all work fantastically with <code>:make</code>.</p>

<p>The last step for me was to create a hotkey in <code>.vimrc</code>, so that I can constantly run my unit tests with just one keystroke:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">noremap &lt;leader&gt;m :make&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If your tests fail, <code>:make</code> fills up Vim's quickfix list with them. In <a href="/blog/2017/03/15/vim-ide-quality-control">episode 2</a>, I already showed you how to enable it to automatically open and close when it's filled or empty, respectively:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">" Automatically open &amp; close quickfix window
autocmd QuickFixCmdPost [^l]* nested cwindow
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-15-vim-ide-testing/phpunit.png" alt="A test in PHPUnit failed" /></p>

<p>If you want to jump through the different errors without focussing on that list, you can just use <code>:cnext</code> and <code>:cprev</code>.</p>

<p>After some testing and trying out, it all seemed to work great for me. Fantastic, up to <a href="/blog/2017/06/15/vim-ide-refactoring">the next episode</a>!</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/05/08/bugfixing-with-git-bisect">Bugfixing with Git Bisect</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Lately, we've deployed code that broke features, that were surely working in the past. Since we're quite heavy committers, things can get lost in our <code>git log</code> quite easily. That makes it harder to go back in history and find out what exactly caused the failure to happen. We simply would have to look through too many commits. That's where <code>git bisect</code> comes in!</p>

<p>The <code>git bisect</code> command provides us with a "binary search" over the commit history: we tell it when things were good for sure, and when they were bad, and bisect will jump to the commit that's in the middle between those two commits. We then test if things work as expected. If it was good at that point we know all history before that point was good, and we move on the the other half of history and apply the same process of dividing it in two and seeing if things work as expected. We do that until we arrive at a point where we know which commit broke things. That's where we need to look. The cool thing is that we can sift through a huge amount of commits in very few steps, and locate the problem quickly. Let's see how that works in practice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <code>git log</code> to find out the commit hash for a commit where we know that things worked. Let's assume for now that the current <code>HEAD</code> we're at is at a point where things fail.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-08-bugfixing-with-git-bisect/1.png" alt="Screenshot of a git log history" /></p></li>
<li><p>Let's start the bisect session and tell git which points were good and bad:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect start
git bisect good {the commit hash where it was good}
git bisect bad
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I didn't specify a commit hash for the <code>git bisect bad</code> command. Bisect assumes that we mean <code>HEAD</code> if we don't specify a commit. Since the current commit is bad, and <code>HEAD</code> always points to the currently checked out commit, we can leave this blank.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-08-bugfixing-with-git-bisect/2.png" alt="Screenshot of the first steps of a git bisect session" /></p></li>
<li><p>Now git will checkout a commit in the middle between our <code>good</code> and <code>bad</code> indications. Just do what you have to do to check if things work or not, e.g. run a unit test, or do some manual checks. Then pass that info on to git with <code>git bisect good</code> if things work, and <code>git bisect bad</code> if they don't.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-08-bugfixing-with-git-bisect/3.png" alt="Screenshot of a git bisect bad" /></p></li>
<li><p>Repeat <em>step 3</em> until git knows which commit went bad. It will indicate the process at every step. When it's done, git will show you the exact commit where things went from <code>good</code> to <code>bad</code>, using <code>git show</code> behind the scenes. You then know where to look to fix your problem.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-08-bugfixing-with-git-bisect/4.png" alt="Screenshot of the result of a bisect session: 1 commit" /></p></li>

<p>To go back to master, do a simple <code>git bisect reset</code>. Congratulations! You've used <code>git bisect</code> to locate a problem in your commit history! Now, there are some more things to know:</p>

<h3 id="when-something-goes-wrong">When something goes wrong</h3>

<p>What if you did something wrong? You typed <code>git bisect bad</code> when everything was fine and you should've typed <code>git bisect good</code>? No worries! Bisect has a secret weapon: <code>git bisect log</code>, which lets you dump the history of this bisect session to a file. You can then remove the faulty step from the file with a text editor, and replay the entire session without that bad step.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Save your session to a file:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect log &gt; {filename}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Remove the faulty line from the file using your favorite text editor:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">vim {filename}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Reset your <code>bisect</code> session:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect reset
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Replay the correct steps:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect replay {filename}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Do the rest of the bisect steps to find out where things went wrong. You can remove the replay file:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">rm {filename}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="automating-the-steps-using-a-script-or-test">Automating the steps using a script or test</h3>

<p>You can automate the recursive steps of telling git that a revision is good or bad, by a simple bash script or unix command that returns a <code>0</code> status code on success, and <code>1</code> on failure. That way, if you have a testsuite, you can use that to really quickly find out where things went wrong by adding a test to it (the code is obviously not tested well or it wouldn't have happened so long ago), and using that test as the command. Let's see how that works:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect start
git bisect good {the commit hash where it was good}
git bisect bad
git bisect run {path to the script to run}
</code></pre>

<p>Don't forget to end your session with a <code>git bisect reset</code> when you found the offending commit.</p>

<h3 id="fantastic-on-fridays">Fantastic On Fridays</h3>

<p>So next time a nasty bug report comes in on a Friday -you're about to leave for a great weekend with your mates- and there were a thousand commits pushed to production that day by your team, don't dispair! Fire up <code>git bisect</code> and find where you need to be in a few minutes time, revert the commit, and enjoy your weekend!</p>

<p>Happy bughunting!</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/05/15/vim-ide-testing">Vim As A PHP IDE - Testing</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p><strong>This blogpost is part of the "Vim As A PHP IDE" series, which starts <a href="/blog/2017/01/01/vim-ide-setting-up">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>I used to always run my unit tests from the command line, but the integration that IDEs give is great. If something goes wrong you can immedately jump to where you need to be to fix it, and your test results remain visible in the same window you're working on. I wanted the same thing in Vim, so I started the investigation.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to use the default Vim <code>:!</code> shell command mode for that (if you want to know more, check <code>:h :!</code>). I was using <a href="http://www.phpspec.net/">phpspec</a> at that time, so I created two hotkeys, one to describe a new class, and one to run the tests. In <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">" PHP run phpspec
noremap &lt;Leader&gt;d :! bin/phpspec desc 
noremap &lt;Leader&gt;o :! bin/phpspec run&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with that approach, is that Vim doesn't know what to do with them, and just shows you the command line output they provide. I wanted more integration between my tools. After some more looking around, I found out that Vim has support to run a <code>compiler</code> command, and interpret its output with some kind of regex. You can run it using <code>:make</code> and if there are errors in the build, it collects them in a list which you can use to jump to the place you need to be to fix it. Sounds just like what I needed!</p>

<p>And yes, it turns out some other people also found that out. There's a <a href="https://github.com/afternoon/vim-phpunit">PHPUnit compiler</a>, which lets you use Vim's <code>:make</code> command with PHPUnit. Great! There also seems to be a <a href="https://github.com/renanivo/phpspec.vim">phpspec compiler</a>.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that Vim picks the right compiler for the right filetype, so you can do something similar for JavaScript files in your project, and have it all work fantastically with <code>:make</code>.</p>

<p>The last step for me was to create a hotkey in <code>.vimrc</code>, so that I can constantly run my unit tests with just one keystroke:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">noremap &lt;leader&gt;m :make&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If your tests fail, <code>:make</code> fills up Vim's quickfix list with them. In <a href="/blog/2017/03/15/vim-ide-quality-control">episode 2</a>, I already showed you how to enable it to automatically open and close when it's filled or empty, respectively:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">" Automatically open &amp; close quickfix window
autocmd QuickFixCmdPost [^l]* nested cwindow
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-15-vim-ide-testing/phpunit.png" alt="A test in PHPUnit failed" /></p>

<p>If you want to jump through the different errors without focussing on that list, you can just use <code>:cnext</code> and <code>:cprev</code>.</p>

<p>After some testing and trying out, it all seemed to work great for me. Fantastic, up to <a href="/blog/2017/06/15/vim-ide-refactoring">the next episode</a>!</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/05/08/bugfixing-with-git-bisect">Bugfixing with Git Bisect</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Lately, we've deployed code that broke features, that were surely working in the past. Since we're quite heavy committers, things can get lost in our <code>git log</code> quite easily. That makes it harder to go back in history and find out what exactly caused the failure to happen. We simply would have to look through too many commits. That's where <code>git bisect</code> comes in!</p>

<p>The <code>git bisect</code> command provides us with a "binary search" over the commit history: we tell it when things were good for sure, and when they were bad, and bisect will jump to the commit that's in the middle between those two commits. We then test if things work as expected. If it was good at that point we know all history before that point was good, and we move on the the other half of history and apply the same process of dividing it in two and seeing if things work as expected. We do that until we arrive at a point where we know which commit broke things. That's where we need to look. The cool thing is that we can sift through a huge amount of commits in very few steps, and locate the problem quickly. Let's see how that works in practice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <code>git log</code> to find out the commit hash for a commit where we know that things worked. Let's assume for now that the current <code>HEAD</code> we're at is at a point where things fail.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-08-bugfixing-with-git-bisect/1.png" alt="Screenshot of a git log history" /></p></li>
<li><p>Let's start the bisect session and tell git which points were good and bad:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect start
git bisect good {the commit hash where it was good}
git bisect bad
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I didn't specify a commit hash for the <code>git bisect bad</code> command. Bisect assumes that we mean <code>HEAD</code> if we don't specify a commit. Since the current commit is bad, and <code>HEAD</code> always points to the currently checked out commit, we can leave this blank.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-08-bugfixing-with-git-bisect/2.png" alt="Screenshot of the first steps of a git bisect session" /></p></li>
<li><p>Now git will checkout a commit in the middle between our <code>good</code> and <code>bad</code> indications. Just do what you have to do to check if things work or not, e.g. run a unit test, or do some manual checks. Then pass that info on to git with <code>git bisect good</code> if things work, and <code>git bisect bad</code> if they don't.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-08-bugfixing-with-git-bisect/3.png" alt="Screenshot of a git bisect bad" /></p></li>
<li><p>Repeat <em>step 3</em> until git knows which commit went bad. It will indicate the process at every step. When it's done, git will show you the exact commit where things went from <code>good</code> to <code>bad</code>, using <code>git show</code> behind the scenes. You then know where to look to fix your problem.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-08-bugfixing-with-git-bisect/4.png" alt="Screenshot of the result of a bisect session: 1 commit" /></p></li>
</ol>

<p>To go back to master, do a simple <code>git bisect reset</code>. Congratulations! You've used <code>git bisect</code> to locate a problem in your commit history! Now, there are some more things to know:</p>

<h3 id="when-something-goes-wrong">When something goes wrong</h3>

<p>What if you did something wrong? You typed <code>git bisect bad</code> when everything was fine and you should've typed <code>git bisect good</code>? No worries! Bisect has a secret weapon: <code>git bisect log</code>, which lets you dump the history of this bisect session to a file. You can then remove the faulty step from the file with a text editor, and replay the entire session without that bad step.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Save your session to a file:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect log &gt; {filename}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Remove the faulty line from the file using your favorite text editor:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">vim {filename}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Reset your <code>bisect</code> session:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect reset
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Replay the correct steps:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect replay {filename}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Do the rest of the bisect steps to find out where things went wrong. You can remove the replay file:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">rm {filename}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="automating-the-steps-using-a-script-or-test">Automating the steps using a script or test</h3>

<p>You can automate the recursive steps of telling git that a revision is good or bad, by a simple bash script or unix command that returns a <code>0</code> status code on success, and <code>1</code> on failure. That way, if you have a testsuite, you can use that to really quickly find out where things went wrong by adding a test to it (the code is obviously not tested well or it wouldn't have happened so long ago), and using that test as the command. Let's see how that works:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect start
git bisect good {the commit hash where it was good}
git bisect bad
git bisect run {path to the script to run}
</code></pre>

<p>Don't forget to end your session with a <code>git bisect reset</code> when you found the offending commit.</p>

<h3 id="fantastic-on-fridays">Fantastic On Fridays</h3>

<p>So next time a nasty bug report comes in on a Friday -you're about to leave for a great weekend with your mates- and there were a thousand commits pushed to production that day by your team, don't dispair! Fire up <code>git bisect</code> and find where you need to be in a few minutes time, revert the commit, and enjoy your weekend!</p>

<p>Happy bughunting!</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/05/02/sliding-window-rate-limiter-redis">Building a sliding window rate limiter with Redis</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>For our Instagram crawler we needed a system to keep track of the amount of API calls we did to prevent us from hitting the rate limits. We could of course perform our HTTP requests without checking rate limits upfront, and wait until we get a <code>429 OAuthRateLimitException</code> from Instagram, but that would exhaust our tokens and block us from talking efficiently to their API.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-02-sliding-window-rate-limiter-redis/429.jpg" alt="Too many cats" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All rate limits on the Instagram Platform are controlled separately for each access token, and on a sliding 1-hour window.</p>
  
  <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/limits">Instagram API rate Limits</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're allowed to do 5000 API calls per access token each hour.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-02-sliding-window-rate-limiter-redis/slidingwindow.png" alt="Sliding window ratelimiting visualisation" /></p>

<p>Every point on the axis represents an API call. The sliding window is an hour in this case. Every time we do an API call we add the timestamp (in microseconds) of the API call to a list. In pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code class="js">timestamps.push(Date.now());
</code></pre>

<p>When we're about to do an API call in our crawler we need to check if we're allowed to do one:</p>

<ol>
<li>How many calls did we do in the last hour?</li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="js">callsInTheLastHour = timestamps.filter(timestamp =&gt; timestamp &gt; now - slidingWindow);
count = callsInTheLastHour.length
</code></pre>

<ol start="2">
<li>How many can we still do?</li>
</ol>

<p>After we calculated the amount of API calls we did in the last hour we can calculate the remaining API calls:</p>

<pre><code class="js">remaining = maxCallsPerHour - count;
</code></pre>

<p>Let's say we did <code>4413</code> API calls in the last hour then we're allowed to do <code>587</code> more at this moment.</p>

<p>Great, we got our algorithm. Now we need some kind of database to store a list of timestamps grouped per access token. Maybe we could use MySQL or PostgreSQL? Yes, we could but then we would need a system that periodically removes outdated timestamps since neither MySQL or PostgreSQL allow us to set a time to life on a row. What about <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcached</a>? Yes, that's also an option. Sadly Memcached doesn't have the concept of an array or list (we could serialize an array using our favourite programming language). We can do better. What about <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>? Yes, I like where this is going. Redis is a key/value store that supports lists, sets, sorted sets and more.</p>

<p>We're ready to translate our algorithm to Redis commands. Assuming you already have Redis installed, start a server: <code>$ redis-server</code>. If you're on a mac, you can just <code>$ brew install redis</code> to get it.</p>

<p>We're going to use a <a href="https://redis.io/commands/#sorted_set">sorted set</a> to hold our timestamps because it fits our needs.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; MULTI
&gt; ZREMRANGEBYSCORE $accessToken 0 ($now - $slidingWindow)
&gt; ZRANGE $accessToken 0 -1
&gt; ZADD $accessToken $now $now
&gt; EXPIRE $accessToken $slidingWindow
&gt; EXEC
</code></pre>

<p>Let's break it down:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>MULTI</code> to mark the start of a transaction block. Subsequent commands will be queued for atomic execution using <code>EXEC</code>.</li>
<li><code>ZREMRANGEBYSCORE $accessToken 0 ($now - $slidingWindow)</code> to remove API call timestamps that were done before the start of the window.</li>
<li><code>ZRANGE $accessToken 0 -1</code> to get a list of all API call timestamps that happened during the window.</li>
<li><code>ZADD $accessToken $now $now</code> to add a log for the current API call that we're about to do.</li>
<li><code>EXPIRE $accessToken $slidingWindow</code> to reset the expiry date for this sorted set of timestamps (for the current OAuth Token).</li>
<li><code>EXEC</code> will execute all previously queued commands and restore the connection state to normal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of using the actual OAuth access tokens (and duplicating them to Redis), you might want to use an identifier or hash of the token instead as <code>$accessToken</code>. It serves as the key for our Redis sorted set. Also note that, in the same transaction as reading the list of timestamps, we <em>add</em> a new timestamp to the list (the <code>ZADD</code> command). We do this because this is being used in a distributed context (we have many workers performing API calls), and we don't want to write when we already exceeded our limits.</p>

<p>In PHP this might look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">// composer require predis/predis
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$maxCallsPerHour = 5000;
$slidingWindow = 3600;

$now = microtime(true);
$accessToken = md5('access-token');

$client = new Predis\Client();
$client-&gt;multi();
$client-&gt;zrangebyscore($accessToken, 0, $now - $slidingWindow);
$client-&gt;zrange($accessToken, 0, -1);
$client-&gt;zadd($accessToken, $now, $now);
$client-&gt;expire($accessToken, $slidingWindow);
$result = $client-&gt;exec();

// The second command inside the transaction was ZRANGE,
// which returns a list of timestamps within the last hour.
$timestamps = $result[1];

$remaining = max(0, $maxCallsPerHour - count($timestamps));

if ($remaining &gt; 0) {
    echo sprintf('%s: Allowed and %d remaining', $now, $remaining) . PHP_EOL;
} else {
    echo sprintf('%s: Not allowed', $now) . PHP_EOL;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To conclude all of this, and to make this work within our codebase, we put this all nicely in a class, behind an interface <code>RateLimiter</code>:</p>

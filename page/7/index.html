            <p>How many times have you seen code like this?</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders()
{
    $coffeeRuns = $this-&gt;coffeeRunsRepository-&gt;getAll();
    $openForOrders = array();

    foreach ($coffeeRuns as $coffeeRun) {
        if ($coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade()) {
            $openForOrders[] = $coffeeRun;
        }
    }

    return $openForOrders;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our office is very close to a <a href="http://simon-says.be/">great coffee bar</a>, and people are going there from time to time to get coffee for everyone in the office. Keeping track of who's going for coffee and who wants which coffee can be daunting, which is why I'm making this app. Let's take a closer look at that piece of code.</p>

<p>We're manually traversing an array of <code>CoffeeRun</code> objects that we got out of the Repository to filter out those who are open for orders. If we find one, we add it to a new array. This way we build a list of <code>CoffeeRuns</code> that are still accepting orders.</p>

<h2 id="to-iterator-or-not%2C-that%27s-the-question">To Iterator or not, that's the question</h2>

<p>Now, there's nothing very wrong with this, but it could be made a whole lot better, I think. Let's say that the Repository contains 1000 <code>CoffeeRun</code>s. We're now forcing the Repository to return an array of 1000 <code>CoffeeRun</code> objects when we call <code>getAll()</code>. That's not great. But let's think about it... The Repository already represents a list of all <code>CoffeeRun</code> objects. Why can't we just iterate over it? Something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders()
{
    $coffeeRuns = $this-&gt;coffeeRunsRepository;
    $openForOrders = array();

    foreach ($coffeeRuns as $coffeeRun) {
        if ($coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade()) {
            $openForOrders[] = $coffeeRun;
        }
    }

    return $openForOrders;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Having a repository we can iterate over like that would already be a first step. We could implement the <code>Iterator</code> interface within the Repository, and have this functionality immediately. But that would leave the foreach out there, and that would also present a problem for our dependency injection: the class where this <code>displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders</code> is a controller, and it has the Repository injected in its constructor, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function __construct(CoffeeRunsRepository $repository)
{
    $this-&gt;coffeeRunsRepository = $repository;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we'd count on the fact that the Repository is now an <code>Iterator</code>, we should either typehint on it, but then we lose our typehint for <code>CoffeeRunsRepository</code>, which we don't want. Or we could make the <code>CoffeeRunsRepository</code> interface extend the <code>Iterator</code> interface, but then we get a really big interface we need to implement for every implementation of the Repository. Both of which are annoying to say the least.</p>

<h2 id="think-solidly-different">Think SOLIDly Different</h2>

<p>Let's try something completely different. In fact, the <code>foreach</code> in that method, is blocking progress for us right now; Let's extract that whole block to a method. This is what was in the controller before the extraction:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders()
{
    $coffeeRuns = $this-&gt;coffeeRunsRepository-&gt;getAll();
    $openForOrders = array();

    foreach ($coffeeRuns as $coffeeRun) {
        if ($coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade()) {
            $openForOrders[] = $coffeeRun;
        }
    }

    return $openForOrders;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the Repository we added a new method <code>openForOrders()</code>, and we kept the same implementation as before, which now resides in the implementation of that method:</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface CoffeeRunsRepository
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @return CoffeeRun[] A list of CoffeeRuns open for orders
     */
    public function openForOrders();

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="php">final class CoffeeRunsRepositoryInMemory implements CoffeeRunsRepository
{
    // ...

    public function openForOrders()
    {
        $coffeeRuns = $this-&gt;getAll();
        $openForOrders = array();

        foreach ($coffeeRuns as $coffeeRun) {
            if ($coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade()) {
                $openForOrders[] = $coffeeRun;
            }
        }

        return $openForOrders;
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is what's left in the controller after extraction:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders()
{
    return $this-&gt;coffeeRunsRepository-&gt;openForOrders();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't like the <code>Repository</code> word in there, while we're thinking about the Repository as just being a Collection. Let's rename the variable in our controller. Notice how well this reads:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders()
{
    return $this-&gt;coffeeruns-&gt;openForOrders();
}
</code></pre>

<p>"Return CoffeeRuns that are Open For Orders". I like it. What's even better, is that the filtering of the Collection is now happening in the object that worries about the Collection, namely the Repository. This means that the specific implementations can optimize for their own benifits. E.g. the database implementation of the Repository can use a specific <code>WHERE</code> query so that it doesn't need to filter <code>CoffeeRun</code>s in PHP, and as a result of that it doesn't need to load a whole list of <code>CoffeeRun</code> objects into memory.</p>

<h2 id="bump-your-head-twice">Bump your head twice</h2>

<p>What if we want a second method in our controller that displays all CoffeeRuns that are open for orders, and will happen before noon? The <code>openForOrders()</code> method won't be enough. We could use it, and then use a <code>foreach</code> as in the first example of the blog post, but then we're back to square one. We could also make it a Repository method, and that would be okay, but only if we don't have to do it too many times. Let's look for a different solution.</p>

<p>It looks like we now have two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>We want to encapsulate the "looping over a list and picking out specific items"</li>
<li>We want to combine several of these actions on a list, or at least do them in succession</li>
</ol>

<p>The problems always come up when we're talking to the Repository. We made two changes to it, that were both half solutions. The Repository has too many responsibilities (Storage and Collection). What would happen if we'd return an object representing a list of CoffeeRun objects from the Repository, and use that to iterate over? The Repository only takes care of the storage, and the Collection object takes care of the Collection stuff.</p>

<p>What we want to do is "filter" CoffeeRuns so that we get CoffeeRuns that are open for orders, and then filter those again so that we get those open for orders that are happening before noon. In pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code class="php">coffeeRuns = repository.getAll
coffeeRuns
    .thatAre(openForOrders)
    .thatAre(happeningBeforeNoon)
</code></pre>

<p>If we can express <code>openForOrders</code> and <code>happeningBeforeNoon</code> as functions that take a <code>CoffeeRun</code> object and return a boolean (we'll call them predicates), then the <code>thatAre()</code> implementation could be very generic! Let's check it out:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$openForOrders = function (CoffeeRun $coffeeRun)
{
    return $coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade();
};

$noon = new DateTime('today noon');
$happeningBeforeNoon = function (CoffeeRun $coffeeRun) use ($noon)
{
    return $coffeeRun-&gt;getDate() &lt; $noon;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now we'll create the <code>CoffeeRuns</code> Collection object, with a <code>thatAre</code> method:</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface CoffeeRuns
{
    /**
     * @param callable function that takes a CoffeeRun and returns a boolean
     *
     * @return CoffeeRuns that match the predicate
     */
    public function thatAre(callable $matchingPredicate);

    /**
     * @return CoffeeRun[] An array of CoffeeRuns
     */
    public function asArray();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's create a naïve <code>array</code> based implementation of it:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class CoffeeRunsArray implements CoffeeRuns
{
    private $coffeeRuns;

    public function __construct(array $coffeeRuns)
    {
        $this-&gt;coffeeRuns = $coffeeRuns;
    }

    public function thatAre(callable $matchingPredicate)
    {
        return new static(
            array_filter(
                $this-&gt;coffeeRuns,
                $matchingPredicate
            )
        );
    }

    public function asArray()
    {
        $this-&gt;coffeeRuns;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Right now, we can have our <code>CoffeeRunsRepository</code> return a <code>CoffeeRuns</code> Collection object for the <code>getAll()</code> method instead of <code>CoffeeRun[]</code> (an array of CoffeeRun) objects, and remove the specific methods we created, like <code>openForOrders()</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface CoffeeRunsRepository
{
    /**
     * @return CoffeeRuns A collection of CoffeeRuns
     */
    public function getAll();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the controller, we now get this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class CoffeeController
{
    private $coffeeRuns;
    private $openForOrders;
    private $happeningBeforeNoon;

    public function __construct(CoffeeRunsRepository $repository)
    {
        $this-&gt;coffeeRuns = $repository;

        $this-&gt;openForOrders = function (CoffeeRun $coffeeRun)
        {
            return $coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade();
        };

        $noon = new DateTime('today noon');
        $this-&gt;happeningBeforeNoon = function (CoffeeRun $coffeeRun) use ($noon)
        {
            return $coffeeRun-&gt;getDate() &lt; $noon;
        };
    }

    public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders()
    {
        $coffeeRuns =
            $this-&gt;coffeeRuns-&gt;getAll()
            -&gt;thatAre($this-&gt;openForOrders);

        return $coffeeRuns-&gt;asArray();
    }

    public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrdersAndBeforeNoon()
    {
        $coffeeRuns =
            $this-&gt;coffeeRuns-&gt;getAll()
            -&gt;thatAre($this-&gt;openForOrders)
            -&gt;thatAre($this-&gt;happeningBeforeNoon);

        return $coffeeRuns-&gt;asArray();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the individual methods got very readable. The operations on the Collections are encapsulated. I extracted the <code>$openForOrders</code> and <code>$happeningBeforeNoon</code> predicates to class variables, because I didn't like the duplication in both controller methods, however, I'm not satisfied with their presence in the constructor. We could create a <code>Predicate</code> interface and make the <code>thatAre()</code> method accept <code>Predicate</code> instances. As a result our controller would just do something like <code>$coffeeRuns-&gt;thatAre(new OpenForOrders());</code>. But let's leave it like this for now. I've got some critical questions coming in:</p>

<h2 id="wait-a-minute%21-you-didn%27t-solve-the-memory-problem%21">Wait a minute! You didn't solve the memory problem!</h2>

<p>Exactly. Let's do that right now.</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class CoffeeRunsWithIterator implements CoffeeRuns
{
    private $coffeeRuns;
    private $predicates;

    public function __construct(Iterator $coffeeRuns, array $predicates = array())
    {
        $this-&gt;coffeeRuns = $coffeeRuns;
        $this-&gt;predicates = $predicates;
    }

    public function thatAre(callable $matchingPredicate)
    {
        $predicates = $this-&gt;predicates;
        $predicates[] = $matchingPredicate;

        return new static(
            $this-&gt;coffeeRuns,
            $predicates
        );
    }

    public function asArray()
    {
        $collectionAsArray = array();

        foreach ($this-&gt;coffeeRuns as $coffeeRun) {
            foreach ($this-&gt;predicates as $predicate) {
                if (call_user_func($predicate, $coffeeRun) !== true) {
                    continue 2;
                }
            }

            $collectionAsArray[] = $coffeeRun;
        }

        return $collectionAsArray;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is an implementation of the <code>CoffeeRuns</code> Collection interface that takes an <code>Iterator</code>. Whenever the <code>thatAre()</code> method gets called with a predicate, we don't do anything, except for creating a new instance of the Collection class with the same <code>Iterator</code> in it, but with the predicate added to the list of predicates that must be matched for each element in the Collection. It's only at the last step, when we try to extract the contents of the collection, that we run the <code>Iterator</code> and check every value against the given predicates. We still need to run the predicates against the whole collection, but because they are within an <code>Iterator</code>, the <code>Iterator</code> can e.g. get them from the database one by one. That's an implementation detail of the Repository.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-we-want-to-be-able-to-use-mysql-%60where%60-statements-in-our-repositories%3F">What if we want to be able to use MySQL <code>WHERE</code> statements in our Repositories?</h2>

<p>Let's say that we want to create a MySQL implementation of the Repository. We don't really want to write a query that will get the whole list of CoffeeRuns, even though we worked with an <code>Iterator</code> before (and thus preserving memory issues), so just passing closures to the <code>thatAre()</code> method will not help us a whole lot to write efficient queries. To improve on that, we could start passing our predicates as objects instead of closures, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface CoffeeRuns
{
    /**
     * @param Predicate that CoffeeRuns need to satisfy
     *
     * @return CoffeeRuns that match the predicate
     */
    public function thatAre(Predicate $matching);

    /**
     * @return CoffeeRun[] An array of CoffeeRuns
     */
    public function asArray();
}
</code></pre>

<p>A predicate could look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface Predicate
{
    /**
     * @param CoffeeRun the CoffeeRun we want to check
     *
     * @return bool if the Predicate is satisfied by given CoffeeRun
     */
    public function isSatisfiedBy(CoffeeRun $coffeeRun);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And to get the same functionality as before we can implement it like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class OpenForOrders implements Predicate
{
    public function isSatisfiedBy(CoffeeRun $coffeeRun)
    {
        return $coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When we have this in place, implementing a repository that can translate these predicates to the correct <code>WHERE</code> statements is pretty much trivial: without doing an actual query, the Repository returns a <code>CoffeeRuns</code> collection object that can be filtered using <code>Predicate</code>s and when that is done, the query can be built by translating the Predicates to the appropriate <code>WHERE</code> statements. Now the <code>Predicate</code> object can still be used to check if a given <code>CoffeeRun</code> satisfies the rule encapsulated within it, but within the Repository, a more efficient way is used against the whole database table full of CoffeeRuns. Eric Evans calls this concept <code>Specification</code>, and you can read all about it in his great book <a href="http://dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/">Domain Driven Design</a>.</p>

<h2 id="doing-something-with-all-objects-in-our-collection">Doing something with all objects in our collection</h2>

<p>Let's say we want people to <code>stopOrdering()</code> for all <code>CoffeeRun</code>s that are happening before noon.</p>

<pre><code class="php">$stopOrdering = function (CoffeeRun $coffeeRun)
{
    $coffeeRun-&gt;stopOrdering();

    return $coffeeRun;
};

$coffeeRuns = $repository-&gt;getAll();
$stoppedOrderingForTheseRuns = $coffeeRuns
    -&gt;thatAre($happeningBeforeNoon)
    -&gt;updateEach($stopOrdering);
</code></pre>

<p>Let's add it to the Collection interface:</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface CoffeeRuns
{
    /**
     * @param Predicate that CoffeeRuns need to satisfy
     *
     * @return CoffeeRuns that match the predicate
     */
    public function thatAre(Predicate $matching);

    /**
     * @param callable function that takes a CoffeeRun and returns an updated one
     *
     * @return CoffeeRuns that got updated
     */
    public function updateEach(callable $update);

    /**
     * @return CoffeeRun[] An array of CoffeeRuns
     */
    public function asArray();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The implementation for the <code>CoffeeRunsArray</code> could be something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class CoffeeRunsArray implements CoffeeRuns
{
    private $coffeeRuns;

    public function __construct(array $coffeeRuns)
    {
        $this-&gt;coffeeRuns = $coffeeRuns;
    }

    public function thatAre(Predicate $predicate)
    {
        return new static(
            array_filter(
                $this-&gt;coffeeRuns,
                function (CoffeeRun $run) use ($predicate) {
                    return $predicate-&gt;isSatisfiedBy($run);
                }
            )
        );
    }

    public function updateEach(callable $update)
    {
        return new static(
            array_map(
                $update,
                $this-&gt;coffeeRuns
            )
        );
    }

    public function asArray()
    {
        $this-&gt;coffeeRuns;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the implementation is trivial in this case, but again it provides us with a powerful abstraction. The code that operates on the Collection doesn't have to know anything about how the Collection is implemented, it just knows about the methods we provided for interacting with it. For those that are into functional programming, we just implemented <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code> here.</p>

<p>I hope you see the value in this. For pieces of code where a lot of actions need to happen on Collections of objects, this might be the way to go. Since the code doesn't have to know anything about the implementation of the Collection, you can change it at any time. For instance, when you start out, you can just use a simple <code>Array</code> implementation, and swap it out for an <code>Iterator</code> later on when you notice memory consumption going up. It can also make things pretty readable, as demonstrated above with the <code>$coffeeRuns-&gt;thatAre(new OpenForOrders());</code>.</p>

<p>You can also choose to go A LOT further, or less far into this, as you desire. Good luck on your explorations!</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/11/02/javascript-deferred">When too many API calls are breaking your app</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>A few weeks ago, I was confronted with a strange issue regarding the "followers" component we have in our inbox.
It's a cool feature that gives you the possibility to check which connected Twitter account is following or followed by another Twitter account. Most accounts or users don't have that many connected Twitter profiles but of course there are always some exceptions. One of our customers had more than 100 connected profiles. The process to check the relationship between the profiles is rather easy. We do a call to the back-end for every profile. In the back-end we do an API call to Twitter to fetch the relationship details. So you can imagine it takes some time if we have to do this for many profiles. In the front-end the component became very slow and it looked like the component crashed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-11-02-javascript-deferred/followers.png" alt="CX Social followers dropdown in inbox" /></p>

<p>After finding out what the problem is, the next step is of course solving it. I started with checking the back-end for some improvements. Instead of calling Twitter's API for every single profile, I checked if we could ask for multiple relations at once. Sadly this wasn't the case. So this trail was a dead end.</p>

<p>If we can't change the API, we could try to avoid using the API as much as possible. By caching the result for some time, we could avoid requesting the same data multiple times as this also improves speed. This wasn't a good option either because the received data was already cached by us in the back-end.</p>

<p>The only thing I could still think of was trying to reduce the calls to the Twitter API or to our own API. Changing the back-end would be a lot of work because the endpoint is used in a lot of places in the front-end. So the only option I wanted to consider was making a change in the one place where we had the problem. In the inbox we loop over the profiles and do a seperate call for every profile. For every call to our API, we wait until we have the response before doing a new call. So instead of doing synchronous calls, we should consider doing the calls asynchronously.</p>

<p>Not knowing if this was possible in Javascript, I started searching and fell upon the <code>Promise</code> object, which does exactly what we need. However, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">the documentation for Promise on MDN</a> quickly revealed that it's not supported by some browsers we still have to support. After some more digging around the internet, we stumbled upon the <code>Deferred</code> object in jQuery which does almost the same, and works in most browsers. From its documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what we actually have to do is start all the calls to the back-end at once. Once we did that we create a new <code>Deferred</code> object. When all the <code>combinedCalls</code> are done, we can start updating our component. It only has to do one big update and it doesn't take that much time because the calls are all fired at the same time instead of one by one.</p>

<pre><code class="js">var profileIds = this.profileIds;

var calls = _.map(services, function (service) {
    var url = '/twitter/relation?accounts='+ service.id +'&amp;users=' + profileIds;

    return $.get(url);
});

var combinedResult = $.Deferred();

var combinedCalls = $.when.apply($, calls);

combinedCalls.done(function() {

    var resultsOfDefferedAjaxCalls = _.toArray(arguments).slice(0, calls.length);

    var relations = _.map(resultsOfDefferedAjaxCalls, function(ajaxResult) {
        return ajaxResult.result.data;
    });

    combinedResult.resolve(relations);
});

combinedCalls.fail(function() {
    // Combine args so that we can pass reason for
    // failure to reject()
    combinedResult.reject();
});

return combinedResult.promise();
</code></pre>

<p>So with some small changes we improved a lot on the loading time of the dropdown. The next problem was that some calls could take some time and if there is one slow call, all the other calls have to wait till the slowest call is finished. So I had to find another solution for this new problem. So instead of just calling the endpoint I added a callback function to the call.</p>

<pre><code class="js">var calls = _.map(services, function (service) {
    var url = '/twitter/relation?accounts='+ service.id +'&amp;users=' + profileIds;

    var onGoingCall = $.get(url);

    onGoingCall.done(callback);

    return onGoingCall;
});
</code></pre>

<p>The moment the call is finished, the callback is triggered and the component will update. You don't have to worry about slow calls because the component will update as soon as possible and the customer can see that data is loading and updating.</p>

<p>That's how we fixed this for now, hopefully we can move to the more modern approach of using <code>Promise</code> in the near future!</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/10/16/coding-web-design-tips">Tips on coding a web design close to reality</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Throughout my experience as a front end developer I've often heard designers complain about how developers fail to code a design accurately. Many designers ask their developers to make a webpage "pixel perfect". Queue developers rolling their eyes! Here I'll share my tips for bringing your code as close as possible to that psd.</p>

<h2 id="setting-expectations">Setting expectations</h2>

<p>One of the most impactful changes you can do is to make sure to set expectations with your designer. At the start it's a good idea to get your team together and figure out which parts of the design will or will not work in reality. If you're lucky you'll have an amazing product team that has done this for you. In reality the developer usually comes up with a technical pain point in the design. For example, if you find that some of the design won't translate in all browsers, you could come up with a compromise with your designer. For example, our gallery of canned responses uses a masonry layout. This layout doesn't look as perfect in Internet Explorer, but we were willing to put up with this because it meant we could use CSS for the masonry layout and not require to use a heavy javascript polyfill plugin. This slight compromise means our website will not have to forsake any page speed for the design.</p>

<small>CX Social Inbox canned responses gallery view in Internet Explorer 10</small>
</center></p>

<p>Ideally you only use javascript when absolutely nescessary for a design. I've seen it happen before that designers have asked for a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> dropdown list of <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>'s to be styled, as the default is not as pretty as in other browsers. This requires a javascript plugin (I wrote one to do this myself at one point). But it's completely unnecessary when it does not affect the user experience that deeply. Users are used to the style of the default option list and it's not worth adding the extra javascript to your website. It's important to weigh up where your javascript is <em>really</em> enhancing the user experience. A slower website makes for a less smooth user experience!</p>

<h2 id="useful-plugins">Useful Plugins</h2>

<p>Let's check out some plugins that can come in handy to keep you and your designer happy!</p>

<h3 id="pixel-perfect">Pixel Perfect</h3>

<p>Designers love when I use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pixel-perfect/">this plugin</a>! You can pop in your design image and then overlay it on top of your webpage. Then you can use the inspector to adjust margins and padding in between elements.</p>

<p>My main advice when using this plugin is to be careful about fonts. Use the plugin to measure the distance <em>between</em> elements rather than making the entire page a perfect copy of the PSD. This is because the font in a PSD will not look the same in every browser. The most important part is getting the line height, margins and padding correct between the text and the next element. In this example you can see that the "Canned Responses" title is not the exact same in the PSD layover.</p>

</center></p>

<h3 id="ruler-plugin">Ruler plugin</h3>

<p>A good <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/page-ruler/">ruler plugin</a> is great for when you want to maintain a consistent guttering/spacing between elements in your design. It also prevents arguments with the designer over whether some spacing is 15px or 20px ;)</p>

<p>Usually spacing between elements is consistent in the design - so if you do spot an inconsistency, ask your designer. E.g. If your webpage <code>h1</code> headings are normally 16px, but in the design they are 15px, this could be a slight mistake!</p>

</center></p>

<h2 id="useful-software">Useful software</h2>

<h3 id="zeplin">Zeplin</h3>

<p><a href="https://zeplin.io/">Zeplin</a> is a program that acts as a middleman between developers and designers. The designer can input the font sizes, spacing between elements and content for the developer to copy. This prevents the developer having to guess the dimensions of the design. It also generates a little bit of CSS - although in my experience you don't end up using most of that. Some CSS properties like <code>box-shadow</code> are useful. It's also useful for translating hex colours.</p>

<h3 id="invision">Invision</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a> is an alternative to Zeplin, but it also includes project mockups. The inspector tool is very similar to Zeplin, so it depends on if you need software for your mockups in addition to software for being the "middleman" between developers and designers.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-browser-inspector">Using the browser inspector</h3>

<p>This is the most important tool of course! Using the up and down keys in the CSS rules section you can tweak the width of elements until you get it right. Editing the styles in the inspector is where I spend most of my time when coding a design.</p>

<p><center>

<small>Using the browser inspector</small>
</center></p>

<p>Utilize the device toolbar to get a preview of your site in other devices. When you're working on compatibility for Internet Explorer, I recommend utilizing the inspector on IE11 (or the latest IE version) as it will give you a preview back to IE8. The inspector in IE11 for compatibility mode gives you a pretty good idea of what something looks like in older versions. When you've done enough tweaking using the compatibility mode you can double check the <em>real</em> IE browser in a tool like <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/" target="_blank">Browserstack</a>. If you don't have BrowserStack you can <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/" target="_blank">download a VM on modern.ie</a>.</p>

<h2 id="always-account-for-responsiveness">Always account for responsiveness</h2>

<p>It's likely your designer will give you a separate spec for the mobile version of your webpage. If they don't, you can ask them if they'd like you to improvise one. But whether you have a mockup for mobile or not, you should always write your code to be responsive. Responsive design is a whole other article, but <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp" target="_blank">I recommend reading up on it</a>!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>As a frontend developer you need to work amicably with your designer to find the best technical solutions when implementing a design. Graceful degredation and user experience are the most important, but hopefully these tips also help you to come to a solution that works well for both the designer and the developer!</p>

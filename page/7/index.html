            <h1><a href="/blog/2018/01/22/some-insights-regarding-value-objects">Some insights regarding Value Objects</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>We've been using Value Objects more and more over the years, and although there's a lot of info out there, there are some things that we found particularly interesting to talk about in a blog post.</p>

<h2 id="what%27s-a-value-object%3F">What's a Value Object?</h2>

<p>Value Objects are simply put <em>objects that represent a value</em>, i.e. objects that don't have an identity except for the value they represent. Very frequently used examples are <code>Money</code> (if someone owes me €5 and they pay me €2 + €2 + €1 I'm happy) and <code>DateTime</code>, but there are lots of things that would qualify. For instance, combined values like a <code>TimeSlot</code> which comprises of two <code>DateTime</code> objects <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>, which is equal to another <code>TimeSlot</code> object if both <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> for both <code>TimeSlot</code> objects are equal. Or points in a 2D plane with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates, where -you guessed it- two points are equal if both points have the same <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates.</p>

<p>A lot of people wonder why they should use Value Objects, instead of passing around primitive values. Let's take some user input in the form of a telephone number, and treat it as a <code>String</code>. We want to pass it around in our code. Somewhere in our code there's a function that expects a telephone number as a parameter. How can it be sure that we passed a telephone number? It can't... Since we're just passing around a <code>String</code>, it needs to do some checks: Does the string look like a telephone number? Does it have a valid country code? etc. The next function that takes a telephone number as a parameter needs to do these checks again. There are some rules about what makes a valid telephone number, which can't be encapsulated in the <code>String</code> representation. If we make a specialized object to represent that phone number, we we can check these rules upon creation of the object, and thus prevent invalid state before it occurs. If some part of our code now gets that <code>PhoneNumber</code> object, it can be sure that it's a valid phone number.</p>

<h2 id="yes%2C-value-objects-should-be-immutable">Yes, Value Objects should be immutable</h2>

<p>Earlier we said that <code>DateTime</code> is a Value Object. Since a <code>DateTime</code> is just a value, once it is instantiated it should represent that value. Let's check something out:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$noon1 = new DateTime('today noon');
$noon2 = new DateTime('today noon');
var_dump($noon1 == $noon2); // bool(true)

$noon3 = $noon1-&gt;modify('+ 2 hours');

var_dump($noon1 == $noon2); // bool(false)
</code></pre>

<p>What happened? I instantiated two <code>DateTime</code> objects that were equal to each other, representing "today at noon". I created a third <code>DateTime</code> object that should represent "today, two hours later than noon". After that, one of the objects that represented "noon" a second ago doesn't anymore. It's like saying: "here you have a 3", and when you start calculating with it, it changed to a 4. This essentially teleported us to another universe where 3 means 4 suddenly.</p>

<p>The reason this happened is because of the fact that the <code>-&gt;modify()</code> call mutates the <code>DateTime</code> object. If we prevent our objects from being changed (make them immutable), they will become a lot safer to work with. In this regard, you should probably always use <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/class.datetimeimmutable.php"><code>DateTimeImmutable</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-introduce-a-value-object%3F">How to introduce a Value Object?</h2>

<p>Let's say we have some code that takes a user's <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/twitter-username-rules">Twitter handle</a> to perform some operations:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class Twitter
{
    public function publicTimelineFor(string $handle)
    {
        $this-&gt;assertValidTwitterHandle($handle);

        // ... fetch &amp; return timeline
    }

    public function tweepsFollowing(string $handle)
    {
        $this-&gt;assertValidTwitterHandle($handle);

        // ... fetch &amp; return followers
    }

    /**
     * @param string $handle
     *
     * @throws InvalidArgumentException when not valid
     */
    private function assertValidTwitterHandle(string $handle)
    {
        // check the rules here, throw exception if not valid
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>assertValidTwitterHandle()</code> must happen in every call that uses the concept of a Twitter handle, but it's so easy to forget when you write a new function! Also, it's impossible to know if a given string has been approved in a previous call. If you now call <code>publicTimelineFor($handle)</code> and <code>tweepsFollowing($handle)</code> in succession for the same <code>$handle</code>, you're basically repeating yourself for no reason. Let's refactor this!</p>

<p>The first thing that you want to do is make sure you get your code under test (it should already be that way 😘). What I like to do in this case, is at least have some tests for what a "valid Twitter handle" means. Since I'll be working towards an object that can only represent a valid Twitter handle, I'll make the <code>private</code> assertion <code>public</code>, write some unit tests against the assertion, and be done with it. We'll change the test later on.</p>

<pre><code class="php">class TwitterHandleTest extends \PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    public function setUp()
    {
        $this-&gt;twitter = new Twitter();
    }

    /**
     * @expectedException InvalidArgumentException
     */
    public function test_it_throws_when_longer_than_16_chars()
    {
        $this-&gt;twitter-&gt;assertValidTwitterHandle('@VeryVeryVeryLongHandleThatShouldThrow');
    }

    // Tests for other rules go here too
    // - handle is a string and should start with '@'
    // - handle contains only uppercase chars, lowercase chars, digits and underscores
    // - make sure to provide some happy path cases as well
    // - you can of course use data providers in your tests to test multiple examples per test
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then create a very basic class for our Value Object:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class TwitterHandle
{
    private $handle;

    public function __construct(string $handle)
    {
        $this-&gt;assertValidTwitterHandle($handle);

        $this-&gt;handle = $handle;
    }

    private function assertValidTwitterHandle(string $handle)
    {
        // check the rules here, throw exception if not valid
    }

    public function __toString(): string
    {
        return $this-&gt;handle;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I created a basic class with the Twitter handle as a string as a constructor parameter. If we use the class as a string, it will cast to the exact Twitter handle as a string that we got as input. This is a temporary measure. I then just moved the <code>assertValidTwitterHandle()</code> method from the <code>Twitter</code> class to <code>TwitterHandle</code>, and made it private. I can fix my tests by just using the constructor of the <code>TwitterHandle</code> class as entry point:</p>

<pre><code class="php">/**
 * @expectedException InvalidArgumentException
 */
public function test_it_throws_when_longer_than_16_chars()
{
    new TwitterHandle('@VeryVeryVeryLongHandleThatShouldThrow');
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code that used to work with handlers in the string form can now easily be changed to accept our object:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function publicTimelineFor(TwitterHandle $handle)
{
    // ... fetch &amp; return timeline
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we just typehint on the Value Object in the function definition, and since the <code>__toString()</code> method is defined to return the same string as we had before, everything just keeps working. With the one perk that the check for valid handles is gone from all our functions! We don't need it anymore, since it's now impossible to pass an invalid handle to them! Now you just need to handle the case of the invalid Twitter handle the moment you get it from the user.</p>

<p>As a final measure, I make sure that the output from the <code>__toString()</code> method can always be parsed back into the same Value Object again, by just giving it to the constructor. In this case that means that I need to return the complete value that the object was instantiated with (which is already the case). If you're tempted to use the <code>__toString()</code> method for other presentational purposes, <a href="http://verraes.net/2013/02/2013-02-16-casting-value_objects/#1-dont-use-_tostring-for-presentation">you're advised to create a specific function for that</a>.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-value-objects">Comparing Value Objects</h2>

<p>Let's say we want to represent points in a <code>x</code> by <code>y</code> two-dimentional plane using a <code>Point</code> Value Object. We've got something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class Point
{
    private $x;
    private $y;

    public function __construct(int $x, int $y)
    {
        $this-&gt;x = $x;
        $this-&gt;y = $y;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Comparing two of these <code>Point</code>s for equality is easy. We can just use PHP's built-in <code>==</code>, which will compare the objects by the values of their properties (exactly what we want for now).</p>

<pre><code class="php">$c1 = new Point(10, 20);
$c2 = new Point(10, 30);
$c3 = new Point(10, 20);

var_dump($c1 == $c2); // false
var_dump($c1 == $c3); // true
</code></pre>

<p>This gets more complicated when we want to e.g. calculate the distance between two <code>Point</code>s. Aren't those <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties private to the object?</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class Point
{
    private $x;
    private $y;

    public function __construct(int $x, int $y)
    {
        $this-&gt;x = $x;
        $this-&gt;y = $y;
    }

    public function distanceTo(Point $other): float
    {
        return sqrt(pow($this-&gt;x - $other-&gt;x, 2) + pow($this-&gt;y - $other-&gt;y, 2));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yes. But since these are two objects of the same type, they can access each other private properties! The code above just works! Be careful though, that you don't change any properties (and therefore make the objects mutable...).</p>

<h2 id="nested-value-objects">Nested Value Objects</h2>

<p>With the <code>Point</code> Value Object that we defined above, we can go a little bit further and represent other things in 2D planes, e.g. line segments, which are defined by two points A and B:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class LineSegment
{
    private $a;
    private $b;

    public function __construct(Point $a, Point $b)
    {
        $this-&gt;a = $a;
        $this-&gt;b = $b;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we just created a Value Object that encapsulates two other Value Objects. This is great, we can successfully represent a <code>LineSegment</code> with this, but there's a problem with this:</p>

<p>The math (the domain in this case) tells us that two line segments are equal if they have the same delimiting points. In our case, we called them <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code>, but actually, the order is not important. This means the <code>==</code> check I described above won't work like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$pointA = new Point(0, 0);
$pointB = new Point(5, 5);

$line1 = new LineSegment($pointA, $pointB);
$line2 = new LineSegment($pointB, $pointA);

var_dump($line1 == $line2); // false
</code></pre>

<p>We can solve that problem using an <code>equals()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class LineSegment
{
    private $a;
    private $b;

    public function __construct(Point $a, Point $b)
    {
        $this-&gt;a = $a;
        $this-&gt;b = $b;
    }

    public function equals(LineSegment $other): bool
    {
        return ($this-&gt;a == $other-&gt;a &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;b == $other-&gt;b)
            || ($this-&gt;a == $other-&gt;b &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;b == $other-&gt;a);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This can now be used to compare lines, but the <code>==</code> still gives wrong results. This is the point where I tell you <code>==</code> is not the best thing to use with Objects in PHP. You cannot override it, or make it work in all cases. It actually breaks encapsulation and checks private properties of objects. But we still want to make it work so that if it gets used instead of the <code>equals()</code> method, nothing breaks. We can then use a rule in our static analysis tools to check for <code>==</code> used with our object. We can make the <code>==</code> work using a fixed order in which point A and B get assigned inside <code>LineSegment</code>'s constructor:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class LineSegment
{
    // ...

    public function __construct(Point $a, Point $b)
    {
        $this-&gt;a = $a;
        $this-&gt;b = $b;

        if ($a-&gt;greaterThan($b)) {
            $this-&gt;a = $b;
            $this-&gt;b = $a;
        }
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our <code>Point</code> objects now need the <code>greaterThan()</code> method, which can be implemented a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class Point
{
    // ...

    public function greaterThan(Point $other): bool
    {
        if ($this-&gt;x == $other-&gt;x) {
            return $this-&gt;y &gt; $other-&gt;y;
        }

        return $this-&gt;x &gt; $other-&gt;x;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can simplify <code>LineSegment</code>'s <code>equals()</code> method, since <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code> will be assigned in order:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class LineSegment
{
    // ...

    public function equals(LineSegment $other): bool
    {
        return $this-&gt;a == $other-&gt;a &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;b == $other-&gt;b;
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even though we don't want people to use <code>==</code> with our <code>LineSegment</code> Value Object, we made it work. Like this, we can prevent unexpected errors in our code. The final code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class Point
{
    private $x;
    private $y;

    public function __construct(int $x, int $y)
    {
        $this-&gt;x = $x;
        $this-&gt;y = $y;
    }

    public function distanceTo(Point $other): float
    {
        return sqrt(pow($this-&gt;x - $other-&gt;x, 2) + pow($this-&gt;y - $other-&gt;y, 2));
    }

    public function greaterThan(Point $other): bool
    {
        if ($this-&gt;x == $other-&gt;x) {
            return $this-&gt;y &gt; $other-&gt;y;
        }

        return $this-&gt;x &gt; $other-&gt;x;
    }
}

final class LineSegment
{
    private $a;
    private $b;

    public function __construct(Point $a, Point $b)
    {
        $this-&gt;a = $a;
        $this-&gt;b = $b;

        if ($a-&gt;greaterThan($b)) {
            $this-&gt;a = $b;
            $this-&gt;b = $a;
        }
    }

    public function equals(LineSegment $other): bool
    {
        return $this-&gt;a == $other-&gt;a &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;b == $other-&gt;b;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we wanted to represent the nested Value Objects as a string, e.g. to be able to save them in a field in the database, we could just make the <code>Point</code> represent itself as <code>(x, y)</code> and the <code>LineSegment</code> as <code>[(Xa, Ya), (Xb, Yb)]</code> by letting the <code>LineSegment</code>'s <code>__toString</code> method call that of the nested <code>Point</code> objects. For parsing the string representation back into a <code>LineSegment</code>, we'll need a <code>fromString()</code> <a href="http://verraes.net/2014/06/named-constructors-in-php/">alternative constructor</a> that can parse those strings and instantiate the correct objects for them, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader!</p>

<p>So, these were our take-aways after introducing Value Objects into our codebase. Did we forget something?</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>As developers, we often rely on exposing services in our software as an HTTP
API. Traditionally, our code would be executed from within a webserver
container. For example, PHP apps might run in
<a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>, or Java apps might run in
<a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>.</p>

<p>In modern apps that strive to be self-contained, you might add a webserver
library and handle requests directly in your code instead.
<a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org">Tornado</a> for Python,
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/">net/http</a> for Golang,
<a href="http://puma.io/">Puma</a> for Ruby or <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/">Jetty</a> for
JVM languages are examples of libraries for this.</p>

<p>Any of these options are typically fine, but sometimes you just want something
much, much simpler. Fortunately, it turns out Linux already comes with
everything you need. First, we need a problem to solve though.</p>

<p>At CX Social we deal with a lot of data. We need to do some maintenance work in
order to keep this data relevant and efficient. What we don't want is to
interfere with the processing we do for our users. We'd rather err on the side
of caution and only run these maintenance jobs when we are sure that servers
aren't currently experiencing high loads. One way to know is by looking at load
averages.</p>

<p>Let's build a simple HTTP API that tells us whether a server is currently busy
or not.</p>

<p>The tools we'll use here are <code>xinetd</code> and plain old <code>bash</code>. Xinetd is a
replacement for the original <code>inetd</code>. This is old software. The <a href="https://github.com/xinetd-org/xinetd">GitHub
mirror</a> of Xinetd has a history going 15
years back. It is simple: it lets you write a server program where you only
need to care about the output. All the other details, like networking, logging,
access control, are taken care of.</p>

<p>First, we'll have to install Xinetd which nowadays isn't installed by default:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ apt-get install xinetd  # on debian
$ pacman -S xinetd        # on arch
$ yum -y install xinetd   # on those other distros
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we'll need to do some configuration. I added following line to my
<code>/etc/services</code>:</p>

<pre><code>load_avg   9876/tcp
</code></pre>

<p>Then I added a file <code>/etc/xinet.d/load_avg</code> with the following contents:</p>

<pre><code>service load_avg
{
  flags = REUSE
  socket_type = stream
  protocol = tcp
  port = 9876
  wait = no
  user = nobody
  server = /data/load_avg
  log_on_failure += USERID
  disable = no
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some comments here. The <code>service load_avg</code> maps to what I added in
<code>/etc/services</code>, the <code>server = ...</code> will be the script that will be called when
a connection is made.</p>

<p>So, let's write the script itself. We'll be using plain bash. If the load
average is fine we'll return a <code>200 OK response</code>. If not, we'll return a <code>503
Service Unavailable</code> instead.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash

http_response() {
  local http_code="$1"
  local message="$2"

  local length=${#message}

  echo -en "${http_code}\r\n"
  echo -en "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n"
  echo -en "Content-Length: ${length}\r\n"
  echo -en "\r\n"
  echo -en "${message}"
  echo -en "\r\n"
}

http_200() {
  http_response "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" "200; $1"
}

http_503() {
  http_response "HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable" "503; $1"
}

load_average=$(uptime | awk '{print $8 * 100}')
acceptable_load=$(nproc | awk '{print $1 * 100}')

if [ ${load_average} -gt ${acceptable_load} ]; then
  http_503 ${load_average}
else
  http_200 ${load_average}
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Let's break it up piece by piece. We start with a couple of functions that help
us construct a valid HTTP response. We can get the length of a value in bash
with <code>${#variable}</code> which is how we set the <code>length</code> variable. For the
rest, nothing particularly interesting is going on.</p>

<p>Next, we get the load average from the <code>uptime</code> command. Bash doesn't have good
support for float values so we get around that by multiplying with <code>100</code> which
lets us compare with <code>-gt</code> later on.</p>

<p>To calculate the acceptable load we cut some corners and simplify things a
little bit: <code>nproc</code> gives us the number of cores in the system so we use that
again multiplying by <code>100</code> so we can compare. So a <code>4</code> core machine would
accept a load of <code>4</code>. I don't love that solution but as an example it's good
enough. In a real setup you would add a little bit of extra margin.</p>

<p>After reloading Xinetd you can use any web client to access
<a href="http://hostname:9876">http://hostname:9876</a>.</p>

<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>

<p>There are a couple of things we can do to improve upon this. We can extract the
<code>http_*</code> functions so we can easily source them as a library in other scripts.
We could render the response as JSON to make parsing the result neater on the
client side.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Often we really do require the capabilities of a full-blown development
environment to implement the features we need. In other situations we can get
away with a simple approach. Xinetd has been around for a very long time and
hides exactly the complexities we'd rather avoid having to deal with.</p>

<p>This technique can be used in interesting combinations. For example, you could
use it with <a href="http://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a> health checks by using a
<code>httpchk</code> rather than a regular <code>tcp-check</code>. Say you have HAProxy in front of
an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a> cluster to automatically spread
searches. You could use our <code>load_avg</code> script above to exclude busy nodes
automatically.  Or say you have a MySQL setup with a handful of replicas for
reading and you use HAProxy to load balance these. You can write a simple
script that checks the <code>seconds_behind_master</code> value and excludes replicas that
are lagging.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you can imagine, there are plenty of reasons that under-represented people in tech aren't going to jump the second your event's CFP opens. But submissions will pour in nonetheless... from the folks whose (devrel/marketing/field engineer) vendor job includes public speaking (and on-the-job time to fine-tune their abstracts). And spoiler alert, many of them will fall into the majority cis het white male demographic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ursula recommends this for the great ideas on how to improve diversity at conferences, and an excellent candid overview of the reasons why underrepresented minorities do not speak at or attend tech conferences as often.</p>

  <p>Your team's strength is not a function of the talent of individual members. It's a function of their collaboration, tenacity, and mutual respect.</p>

<p>Hans likes this because when there's a smart guy around, you'll find it tempting to just go ask him instead of trying to do the research yourself and learn something new. He doesn't like developers who think that they know everything. They don't. In fact, you'll never know everything. Sharing knowledge and working together as a team is something we should focus on instead. Each person has their own strengths.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't reward good behaviour with scotch, don't tap kegs at 12pm, and don't host video game or ping pong tournaments. Don't call your employees "rockstars". Shine a harsh light on some of your internal slack channels. If your company doesn't perpetuate the kind of culture that makes women feel like they need to be 'one of the boys', they won't need the coping mechanism of the "cool tech girl".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ursula has seen this type of behaviour from women in tech in many countries. "I would almost go as far as to say that if you don't fit into the 'cool tech girl' box, it's difficult to survive. As a woman in tech I think you have a responsibility to speak up for diversity in the industry. It's really hard, and it's great to hear viewpoints that identify that."</p>

<p>Toon recommends this because Alberto Brandolini is a great speaker, and his vision on Domain Driven Design and software development in general is really clear and deep. He goes a long way to understand the business, and the problems associated with the business. He goes out of his way to find out how he can solve them.</p>

<p>Jurriaan likes this because too much of technical literature is about how you should start doing things, and how everything you’ve done in the past is probably wrong. This article captures the essence of trying to architect real-life development projects.</p>

  <p>With a self-service application provisioning workflow in place, SRE can devote more of our time to delivering infrastructure products to the rest of the engineering organisation in support of our best practices, building toward a faster and more resilient GitHub experience for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeffry liked this because everybody and their dog are rethinking how to do platform now that the technology to do so has matured. This write-up from Github offers a great look into the decision making and preparation that goes into gradually building up confidence. He gives the author additional points for sprinkling snippets of inspiration throughout the post: e.g. chatops-rpc to make our hubot do more than offer drunk commentary, Kelsey Hightower's "Kubernetes the hard way" which he has set his mind to working through over the holidays, flipper and mission control bar and simulating kernel panics with sysrq-trigger.</p>

  <p>It’s impossible to know if this talk started on time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Toon recommends this because Eric Evans uses his own Domain Driven Design to explore better ways to think about time. Very inspiring. He shows how "generic" subdomains of software development are not generally "solved problems", and how you can make a difference there, as a programmer.</p>

  <p>Humor has a certain relationship to seriousness. It is appropriate to joke about serious things, but only after the right amount of time has passed. For example, it took years for me to be able to crack a smile when I remember my favorite uncle’s last words: "Hold my beer".</p>
  
  <p>I'm so proud of you, little teapot. You've run your first Clojure program! Not only that, but you've become acquainted with the REPL, one of the most important tools for developing Clojure software. Amazing!</p>

<p>Niek thinks this book is a hilarious and down-to-earth explanation of yet another programming language to learn. Clojure is a Lisp dialect and will melt your brain with its elegance!</p>

<p>Toon enjoyed this because this guy solves real world problems for people using Excel. "I learned a 100 things from seeing him work like this." He knows Excel inside out.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>We're all heavy Git users in the CX Social development team. Honestly, we couldn't survive without it, as some of us are located across the planet, and we also use GitHub as our primary source of information, even when talking to other teams like the "Customer Support" team. Here's some small tips we learned along the way, when it comes to keeping your Git history clean.</p>

<h2 id="%60git-log%60-like-a-boss"><code>git log</code> like a boss</h2>

<p>I personally like to see everything there is to see about my git history. That's why I have an alias for <code>git log</code> that upgrades it with two default flags:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git log --decorate --name-status
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--decorate</code> flag shows ref names next to commits, meaning that you can see where <code>HEAD</code> points, and where your current (and remote) branches are pointing.</p>

<p>The <code>--name-status</code> flag activates the functionality to display which files were changed in that commit, below your commit message. This is great to see what changed in a commit, at first glance.</p>

<h2 id="writing-proper-commit-messages">Writing proper commit messages</h2>

<p>Another great tip, and maybe the best thing you'll take away from this blog post, actually comes from <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">another blogpost</a> which talks about writing great <code>git commit</code> messages. If you haven't read that post, go read it now, it's awesome. The main things I took away from it are these:</p>

<ul>
<li>use a proper text editor (like Vim) for writing your commit messages</li>
<li>write a commit subject as the first line, which complete this sentence:
<code>if applied, this commit will...</code></li>
<li>keep a blank line between the subject and what follows</li>
<li><strong>always</strong> write a commit body with <strong>what</strong> changed, and <strong>why</strong> you changed it.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're too stubborn to write your commit messages using a decent text editor, here's a trick for you: you can use the <code>-m</code> flag on your command line more than once, to create paragraphs, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git commit \
-m "Add a second Hyperdrive as a backup" \
-m "When being followed by an imperial fighter, we want to be able to jump to hyperspace even though our first drive fails." \
-m "We're afraid this might cause some more radiation than expected."
</code></pre>

<p>But still, really consider using a text editor.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-versioning">Distributed versioning</h2>

<p>Git is a distributed versioning system, which means that it's designed to work offline, without a connection to the remote. We might as well exploit that to have great git history.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>git checkout</code> your own feature branch to work on something</li>
<li>don't <code>push</code> or <code>pull</code> while working on your feature. This gives you the advantage that you can <code>amend</code> your commit messages if you made a mistake, or that you can even <code>rebase</code> or <code>squash</code> your commits for clarity.</li>
<li>when you're done, push your branch. If you're working alone on your feature branch, this will work fine and you're done. If there are other people working on the same branch, don't panic and proceed to the next step</li>
<li><code>git pull --rebase origin {branch-name}</code> and then push</li>
</ul>

<p>As I mentioned before, <strong>not</strong> pushing or pulling, and still being able to work is a great feature of git. It means that you can work offline and do everything as if you were the only developer working on a project. You can undo mistakes you made in git, say, you forgot to include a file in a commit. Just <code>git commit --amend</code> it to your liking. Just don't go around and change parts of history that were already pushed.</p>

<p>Now the <code>--rebase</code> part in the <code>git pull</code> step is where it gets interesting. What this does, is undo everything you did since the last time you pulled the branch. Then it pulls from the remote, so that it's a fast-forward without conflicts with 100% certainty. And then it will apply your commits to that. This means that if you changed something, and someone else changed the same thing, you will have a rebase conflict. Which is great! You can now just fix your own conflict, and the history will still be linear! This also means that you will have to fix your own conflicts from now, instead of fixing other people's conflicts. Go on and push your branch when your done.</p>

<h2 id="merging-master-in-your-feature-branch">Merging master in your feature branch</h2>

<p>In analogy with what I said before, you can look at your feature branch as an "isolated" place where you can work on your feature in separation of everything that happens in other branches. Just do what you wanted to do, and never merge any branch into it, or at least minimize the amount of times you merge in case you really really have to.</p>

<p>The advantage this gives you, is great linear history in your feature branch, which <strong>only</strong> applies to that feature, which makes it easy to review or merge into other branches. This is even more true if you use the <code>git pull --rebase</code> feature from the previous tip.</p>

<p>Now, when your feature is ready and there are merge conflicts between your feature branch, and the branch you want to merge it into, e.g. <code>master</code>, you can solve that easily. Merge master in your branch once, and fix your own conflicts. Then merge your branch into master. There are some rebase tricks you can do here to keep linear history too, but I prefer to still merge branches when a feature is done.</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/01/07/distributed-processing-via-rabbit-mq">Distributed Processing via RabbitMQ</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Looking at <a href="https://stackshare.io/clarabridge-cx-social/web-application-stack">the tech stack of our CX Social product</a>, there's tens of components involved, and this post will go into detail about one of the most central components of our system: our RabbitMQ service.</p>

<p>RabbitMQ, or at least the concept of "Message Brokers" it implements, is central to the way we capture and digest the hundreds of social media messages we track each second, but also in how we throw around workload and tasks. Actually, it's so central we often take it for granted. So, let's take a step back and see why we use it ...</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-queueing-system%3F">What is a Queueing System?</h2>

<p>Almost too simple to explain, a queueing system is a service where you can pile up a bunch of things to do (tasks) or messages to process (social media tweets etc. in our case). Different processes put messages on the queue (publish) while multiple other processes (consumers), possibly on other servers, read from these queues to e.g. execute a certain process.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/2017-01-07-distributed-processing-via-rabbit-mq/queue.png" alt="What Is A Queue?" /></center></p>

<p>At Clarabridge CX Social, we use <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, but there's also <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">Amazon SQS</a> as often used alternatives.</p>

<p>Below is a screenshot of our RabbitMQ dashboard, showing a.o. about 3000 messages per second being processed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-01-07-distributed-processing-via-rabbit-mq/rabbitmq-dashboard.png" alt="RabbitMQ Dashboard" /></p>

<h2 id="so%2C-what%27s-cool-about-queues%3F">So, What's Cool About Queues?</h2>

<h3 id="1.-do-stuff-async-and-handle-peaks">1. Do Stuff Async and Handle Peaks</h3>

<p>If at any point in our code we can procrastinate, we try to do so. If it's not super important to execute a certain function immediately, we push a message onto one of our RabbitMQ queues containing enough information to execute the function later, potentially by someone else. Easy. And lazy.</p>

<p>An example where we do this, is in the processing of webhooks for Facebook. For every like or comment that happens on one of the Facebook Pages that our CX Social clients own, Facebook sends us a real-time update containing who commented/liked which post. This information needs to be added to our clients' inboxes as soon as possible, but it's not vital that that's done in the same webhook-request that Facebook sends us. So, this page just pushes whatever information it gets from Facebook onto a queue. And an army of consumers for this queue turns these messages in e.g. comment objects to add to our data cluster.<br />
Whenever a Facebook post we monitor turns out to be hugely popular, and hundreds of post interactions per second is no exception, this queue serves both as a buffer (so we can handle these peak moments) and as a distributor (so multiple processes can massage and index the data).</p>

<p>Other common use cases include emailing or notifying several people. Say you have an online shop, and you want to notify a whole bunch of subscribers as soon as you add a new item to the inventory. Instead of sending these notifications in the same web request that the admin adds a product in, you push the notification-job on a queue, and let a different process send the actual emails or push notifications. Your initial request ("Add product x") stays fast, while all necessary emails are sent in the background.</p>

<h3 id="2.-split-up-complex-problems">2. Split up Complex Problems</h3>

<p>Queues are also particularly handy to split up heavy tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks of work. By using queues as the glue between these steps, you create more visibility into this chain of events.</p>

<p>One such chain that is vital to CX Social is the processing of a new incoming message (a tweet, an Instagram photo, etc.). Whenever a new messages is capture by our data crawling systems, there's several steps we need to do to get it to our clients, including:</p>

<ol>
<li>Checking which of our clients are interested in the message by matching it to the set-up of their accounts.<br />
(E.g. does it contain any of the keywords they're monitoring? Is it from a social profile they own?)</li>
<li>Resolving any of the urls in the post, as to get more details about the linked sites.</li>
<li>Computing the language the post's text is in.</li>
<li>Making an estimated guess of what the sentiment of the post could be.</li>
<li>Predict any labels that the client uses often for this particular post.</li>
<li>Indexing it to our main data cluster (ElasticSearch).</li>
<li>Predicting a possible reply for the post, if actionable.</li>
<li>Sending a notification to logged in users to their interfaces update with the new data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each step of this process involves different services, of which some might be external, or slow, or down. By splitting this big chunk of work into smaller steps that are executed in sequence (each step generates an event that the next step listens to), we have better control over the execution of these steps. In addition, each step is simpler to monitor and thus debug (both in resource usage as speed).</p>

<h3 id="3.-give-certain-jobs-priorities">3. Give Certain Jobs Priorities</h3>

<p>By using different queues for different types of tasks, and by playing around with the amount of consumer-processes you have running for a certain queue, you have control over the priority of the tasks you push to this service, and different queues and types of tasks don't affect each other.</p>

<h3 id="4.-cross-service-communication">4. Cross-Service Communication</h3>

<p>We also use RabbitMQ in case different services need to talk to each other. At Clarabridge CX Social we have a service for real-time communication to a user's browser using websockets (via node.js/Socket.io). Every other service in our cluster can just send their messages there via RabbitMQ.
If a certain php process needs to send a real-time notification to a certain logged in user, the php process publishes an event to a RabbitMQ queue. A node.js server will then consume the event, and passes it on the client via socket.io.<br />
Using RabbitMQ as the intermediate we allow services written in a multitude of different languages to talk to each other.</p>

<h3 id="5.-monitoring-made-easy">5. Monitoring Made Easy</h3>

<p>A benefit of architecting your application this way, is that your Message Broker becomes an important and easy service to monitor, giving early indications when problems arise. As soon as a certain queue is growing beyond its expected volume, it's often an indication of a process that is slower than expected, or fully down.</p>

<p>If you monitor ...</p>

<ul>
<li>the amount of messages on a queue at any time;</li>
<li>the age of the oldest messages on a queue;</li>
<li>the rate of publishing to a queue;</li>
<li>the rate of consuming from a queue;</li>
</ul>

<p>... you have a very good indication of the health and performance of your application.</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/01/01/vim-ide-setting-up">Vim As A PHP IDE - Setting Up</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I always get a lot of critique and disbelief when I mention that I use Vim to do my daily work in our PHP codebase. Most people in PHP have become avid users of <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>, a great PHP IDE made by JetBrains. I'm unsure about my own reasons to use Vim over PhpStorm but I guess these are some factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>I do not only write PHP</li>
<li>I love the fact that using Vim is like speaking a language</li>
<li>I live in my terminal</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm hereby starting a blog series about how I use Vim as my IDE of choice for PHP development. This is not a Vim tutorial, I'm assuming that you can look up the basics <a href="http://vimcasts.org/">anywhere else</a> and that you know about <code>:h :h</code>. However, I'll show you how I manage to do my work in Vim, how you can accomplish the same thing, and that I don't have a lot of missing features compared to users of other IDEs. This will be a blog series, and I'll list up episodes below as they come out. Let's start with setting up for a really basic PHP oriented workflow.</p>

<h2 id="basic-%60.vimrc%60-setup">Basic <code>.vimrc</code> setup</h2>

<p>First of all, never put things in your <code>.vimrc</code> that you don't understand. There's a huge amount of documentation in Vim's built-in help pages, which you can access like this: <code>:h &lt;keyword&gt;</code>. These are some simple things that I put in my <code>.vimrc</code> that I want at all times:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">filetype plugin indent on " use the file type plugins
syntax on                 " Syntax highlighting
set number nu             " Line numbers
set cursorline            " Color the cursorline
set autoindent            " Auto indenting
set smartindent           " Smart indenting
</code></pre>

<h2 id="basic-packages-i-use-all-the-time">Basic Packages I Use All The Time</h2>

<h3 id="package-manager">Package Manager</h3>

<p>To be able to easily install Vim plugins, I use <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a> or another Vim package manager, they make it so much easier to install the other packages.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-cursors">Multiple Cursors</h3>

<p>Even though it's really not Vim-like to use this, sometimes it comes in handy to have multiple cursors, even though we all know it can be done using find-and-replace or using Vim's macros. There are multiple packages for this, I use <a href="https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors">this one</a>.</p>

<h3 id="surroundings">Surroundings</h3>

<p>Adding, removing and editing brackets around all Vim objects like "words", "paragraphs", "HTML-tags", etc has been made super easy with <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround">surround.vim</a>, which makes all these actions feel like they were in Vim all along.</p>

<h3 id="sessions">Sessions</h3>

<p>To manage my sessions, I usually don't use any plugins, since Vim has basic session management built in. You can save your current session using <code>:mksession! &lt;name&gt;</code>. Vim will save a file with the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> you specified. If you then close vim, you can come back to the same session by starting vim like this: <code>vim -S &lt;name&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>If you go with the aforementionned approach, your sessions won't be saved automatically. If you want to get more out of your sessions, you might want to try the <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-obsession">vim obsession</a> plugin.</p>

<h3 id="snippets">Snippets</h3>

<p>As a last general purpose plugin, I'll recommend some snippet managers. I myself don't use any of them, just because I started out with a very basic Vim setup and I didn't yet feel the need for one of them. But if you'd like one, check out <a href="https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips">UltiSnips</a> or <a href="https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim">SnipMate</a>.</p>

<h2 id="php-specific-things-for-your-%60.vimrc%60">PHP Specific things for your <code>.vimrc</code></h2>

<p>Let's start looking at some PHP specific configurations. I created a specific <code>augroup</code> section in my <code>.vimrc</code>, to be able to define <code>autocmd</code>s that can be overwritten if I reload my <code>.vimrc</code>. I'll reference this <code>augroup</code> in the following episodes of this series, too. Let's use it to run the <code>php -l</code> linter after we save a PHP file. Here we go:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">augroup PHP
  autocmd! " Clear all autocmd's in this group before running them again

  " Check for PHP syntax errors after saving a file
  autocmd BufWritePost {*.php} echom system("php -l ".expand('%'))

augroup END
</code></pre>

<p>Let's set some basic configuration for all PHP files that we'll open. Create a file called <code>~/.vim/ftplugin/php.vim</code> and put this in it:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">" Some basic PSR code style rules
set tabstop=4           " Tab width
set softtabstop=4       " Soft tab width
set shiftwidth=4        " Shift width
set expandtab           " Use spaces instead of tabs
</code></pre>

<p>When I talk to people about their IDE of choice, which I don't do often, these are some topics which seem to be important:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/2017/02/15/vim-ide-exploring-code">exploring the codebase</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/2017/03/15/vim-ide-quality-control">quality control</a></li>
<li>git integration</li>
<li>testing integration</li>
<li>refactoring</li>
</ul>

<p>In the upcoming posts, I'll talk about those in more detail!</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/06/15/vim-ide-refactoring">Vim As A PHP IDE - Refactoring</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p><strong>This blogpost is part of the "Vim As A PHP IDE" series, which starts <a href="/blog/2017/01/01/vim-ide-setting-up">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I kept the best for last. The feature I get the most questions about is the refactoring capabilities of IDEs. While Vim has some great features that most IDEs don't have, it certainly is true that this is one of the features that Vim is not really that good at. Or is it? In any case, it's good enough at it for me. Let's see what we got.</p>

<h2 id="how-would-you-do-it-from-the-cli%3F">How would you do it from the cli?</h2>

<p>Basically, if some functionality is not in Vim by default, there are two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a command line tool that already does the job - this is how Vim fits into the UNIX philosophy.</li>
<li>Use Vimscript to program the functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily, there's this neat tool called <a href="https://github.com/QafooLabs/php-refactoring-browser/">PHP Refactoring Browser</a>, that already knows how to do some PHP refactorings from the command line.</p>

<ul>
<li>extract method;</li>
<li>rename local variable;</li>
<li>local variable to instance variable;</li>
<li>optimise use statements;</li>
</ul>

<p>The tool is also open source, so we can add missing refactorings in the future. The tool is standing on the shoulders of giants like <a href="https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser">PHP Parser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Andrewsville/PHP-Token-Reflection">PHP Token Reflection</a>. But doing this from the command line isn't that great...</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/refactoring-browser.png" alt="Running the Refactoring Browser from the command line" /></p>

<h2 id="vim-integration">Vim integration</h2>

<p>Of course, some people already thought this was useful for Vim people, and created <a href="https://github.com/vim-php/vim-php-refactoring">a plugin</a> to wrap the command line tool. I'm assuming you installed the command line tool in <code>/usr/local/bin/refactor.phar</code>. Install the plugin using your favorite Vim package manager, and put this line in your <code>.vimrc</code> to let the plugin know where to look for the executable:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">" PHP refactoring browser
let g:php_refactor_command='/usr/local/bin/refactor.phar'
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/refactoring-in-vim.png" alt="Running the Refactoring Browser from within Vim" /></p>

<p>You can now do these basic refactorings using their hotkey <code>&lt;Leader&gt;r</code> and selecting your desired refactoring from the list. That's nice, but there are some refactorings missing that we'd like, e.g. "Extract Interface".</p>

<h2 id="creating-refactorings-with-vimscript">Creating refactorings with Vimscript</h2>

<p>While the best solution would definitely be to contribute to the PHP Refactoring Browser, we want to have this functionality right now. Let's create the "Extract Interface" refactoring in Vimscript. I'd like to select some class methods using linewise <code>VISUAL</code> mode, issue a command on it, fill in the name of the Interface that I'd like the methods be extracted to, and have the current class implement that method. Let's see what we got:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">command! -range PhpExtractInterfaceFromRange &lt;line1&gt;,&lt;line2&gt;call PhpInterfaceFromRange()

function! PhpInterfaceFromRange() range
  let interface = input('Enter extracted interface name: ')
  call PhpExtractInterface(a:firstline, a:lastline, interface)
endfunction

function! PhpExtractInterface(start, end, interface)
  normal! qkq
  execute ''.a:start.','.a:end.'g/public.*function.*(\_.\{-})/normal ^f(V%"Ky'
  let @k = substitute(@k, ' \?{', '', 'g')
  let @k = substitute(@k, ')', ');', 'g')
  ?class
  execute "normal! A implements ".a:interface
  execute "normal! Ointerface ".a:interface
  execute "normal! o{\&lt;CR&gt;}\&lt;CR&gt;"
  normal! k"kP
  normal! dd
endfunction
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>We create a command, called <code>PhpExtractInterfaceFromRange</code> which can be called with a Vim range (like <code>10,50</code>, or from a <code>VISUAL</code> select). If the command is issued, it calls a Vimscript function with the name <code>PhpInterfaceFromRange()</code></li>
<li>The <code>PhpInterfaceFromRange()</code> function asks the user how they want to call their new interface, and passes the range and the name of that interface to <code>PhpExtractInterface()</code></li>
<li>Here's where the real magic happens. We clear register <code>k</code>, and search for all public method definitions in the specified range. We then append every definition to the <code>k</code> register. We then remove curly braces <code>{}</code> and put the missing <code>;</code> after every method definition. We search for the start of the current class, and make it implement the interface. We then create the interface with the contents of the register <code>k</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/extract-interface-1.png" alt="Extracting an interface from a class with one method selected in Visual Mode" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/extract-interface-2.png" alt="Interface was extracted successfully" /></p>

<p><strong>Wow</strong></p>

<p>Since this is now a command, it could easily be assigned a <code>&lt;Leader&gt;</code> hotkey for visual mode selects, for instance. And you could easily do the same thing for e.g. "Extract Class".</p>

<p>Now, I created this in half an hour, and it's perfectly usable in most use cases, but it's not perfect. As this is the only refactoring I really missed from the Refactoring Browser, I'll just use this until a real refactoring gets integrated in the real plugin. There are plugins with some more Vimscript implementations of refactorings, like <a href="https://github.com/adoy/vim-php-refactoring-toolbox">this one</a>. Keep in mind that they will be susceptible to mistakes, as they don't <em>really</em> understand your PHP code like the Refactoring Browser does.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>So, that's it for this episode, and for now this will also be the end of this blog series for now. I hope you liked it! Happy Vimming!</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/06/01/internship-gheerwijn-cx-social-developer">What it&#039;s Like to Intern at CX Social</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>This February, Gheerwijn joined the CX Social development team as an intern. Now, three months later, with the bulk of his internship over, we’ve asked him what that was like and what he built.</p>

<h3 id="building-a-social-profile-manager">Building a Social Profile Manager</h3>

<p>The idea for the subject of the internship started a few years ago when several of our customers, including the <a href="https://twitter.com/nmbs">Belgian Railways NMBS</a>, started showing off their Twitter reply times in their cover photo. NMBS took the reply time for their Twitter profile from the CX Social API and wrote the necessary code to showcase that on their page.</p>

<p><center>
<img src="/images/2017-06-01-profile-manager-internship-gheerwijn/nmbs.png" alt="NMBS Twitter Profile" /><br />
<small>NMBS Twitter Profile</small>
</center></p>

<p>We thought it would be great to build this into CX Social itself and improve on the idea with the extra features our tool offers, like having different cover images depending on your business hours, or showing different avatars depending on if a certain crisis plan is active. 
Gheerwijn, a student of <a href="https://www.odisee.be/nl/elektronica-ict">Electronica - ICT at Odisee Gent</a>, took on this challenge and dove right in.</p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn</strong>: <em>"The main purpose of the Profile Manager is to give CX Social customers a single place to manage all of their owned social profiles. Not only can it manage basic profile information, but it can also perform more complex tasks. The most striking feature of the Profile Manager is the ability to create themes. These themes are a combination of a profile photo and cover photo."</em></p>

<p>The idea was to offer clients the possibility to upload their own pictures and even annotate them. These annotations include plain text, but also variables like "reply time" or "unique users serviced".</p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"After a theme has been created, it can be scheduled for one or more profiles. This means that CX Social users can choose when a specific theme, like a Christmas theme, should be shown on certain profiles. We've also added the option to show different themes during/outside configured business hours schedules."</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>"This feature gives companies with a large customer base on social the ability to be transparant on how long it will approximately take to get an answer to their questions."</em></strong> - Gheerwijn</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="using-react-and-node.js">Using React and Node.js</h3>

<p>When asked about what were some of the most interesting aspects of the project, Gheerwijn cites the JavaScript library React and the backend technology Node.js as two fun technologies to work with.</p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"I had heard of React but never actually used it. A first experiment I did with it was a component to handle the scheduling of a theme. It proved to be an excellent way to quickly create interactive user interfaces, so I started to use it for everything I possibly could."</em></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"I also got to work on a Node.js microservice. Although I had already worked with Node.js on several occasions, I got to use new modules and libraries, like Fabric, which made it an interesting learning opportunity. I love how Node.js brings the joy of writing JavaScript to the backend.
The hardest part to get right was having the annoted images render correctly, both on the front-end as well as in the back-end."</em></p>

</center></p>

<p><strong>CX Social: Did you acquire any non-technical skills while working here?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn</strong>: <em>"Preparing for the weekly status meetings was a great way to learn how to separate the important things from the less important ones. It forced me to spend more time thinking about how the users would eventually use this feature. I learned that things that are obvious to the programmer aren't necessarily clear to the users."</em></p>

<h3 id="a-look-behind-the-scenes">A Look Behind the Scenes</h3>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"What drew me to this internship proposal was the fact that it involved social media. Everyone and their mother has a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram account. Not only individuals, but also companies are using social media on a daily basis. In this day and age, social media is something irreplaceable.
I started at CX Social because I wanted a look behind the scenes."</em></p>

<p><strong>CX Social:</strong> <strong>Did you have any idea what to expect that first day you started?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>I actually expected it to be quite stressful, mainly because it was such a big project to complete, but also because you suddenly start working in a company and you have to get to know everything and everyone.</em></p>

<p><strong>CX Social:</strong> <strong>So, how high were the stress levels then?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"Well, the team was very helpful. I felt like a real part of the team and not just ‘the intern’.
Anthony helped me out with getting to know the do's and don'ts in the codebase. Hans introduced me to several best practices and ways to make my code better. Down the road, I got to work with Jared and Ursula, who both took care of the design. Jurriaan was always able to come up with a solution to problems I would've never been able to fix on my own. And Toon showed me how to integrate my features in the task-scheduling back-end of CX Social. In the end, I got to work with everyone from the development team. I learned a lot just from asking other people how they would approach a certain problem."</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>"It was also great to be able to have my feedback always taken into account when making decisions."</em></strong> - Gheerwijn</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"When I thought something didn't make sense the way it was expected to be implemented, my thoughts about what I thought should change were actually taken into account and implemented."</em></p>

<p><strong>CX Social: Any moments during your internship that stood out?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"There are two moments I won't forget. The team went on a two-day off-site bootcamp. It was the perfect way to get to know all the team members. After an entire day of working, the evenings were filled with fun activities. It was certainly not something I was expecting to do during my internship!
The second unforgettable moment was the last day of my internship. After months of working on this one feature, the time had come to deploy it to production. We spent the last days pair programming the last bits to be able to put it live for testing. It was great seeing the work I did go live to beta-testers."</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>"Let me end with sharing an important tip for any interns after me: Work hard and buy a Nerf gun. You won't survive long without one."</em></strong> - Gheerwijn</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>A few weeks ago, we went on a two-day off-site with the CX Social development team for an event we dubbed "improvement bootcamp". It's the second time we did something like this and since it was fun and we got quite a lot of stuff done, we wanted to share our story. Maybe it could work for your team as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-roadmaps">The problem with roadmaps</h2>

<p>The idea behind a bootcamp is "drop everything, let's work on something else, someplace else for a few days". For two days, we were hidden away in a beautiful house in the fields of Waasland where we focused solely on what we like to call "little big details".</p>

<p>Over the course of the 6+ years that our product has existed, we have built up a huge database of customer requests. Prioritization and implementation of those requests is a constant process; in fact, almost all of our roadmap is compromised of client-requested features. We take logging these requests very seriously. Feature requests come to us through our ideas forum (where clients can post &amp; up-vote ideas), via our Live Chat, and via our dedicated Customer Success team. All of this information (what is requested, who is requesting it, if it's technically possible/feasible, etc.) is then ranked by priority and, after being curated by the Product Team, makes up the roadmap.</p>

<p>That roadmap becomes our daily job, at least when we're not playing <a href="https://engagor.github.io/blog/2017/03/01/batman-chatman/">Batman</a>. We always have a detailed roadmap for the next release of our product (around three months), and a more general one for the upcoming 12 months. This balance works for us; we can commit certain projects to our customers, while on the longer term we can stay flexible, react quickly to changing customer demands, and implement new social functionality when it becomes available.</p>

</center></p>

<p>But, as it often goes, projects aren't perfectly defined from the start (their scope often grows) and we developers tend to underestimate projects, so getting everything finished on-time sometimes (more often than we’d like) results in neglecting some of the details. Those are the details that make a product stress-free, or - why not - even fun to use.</p>

<p>The "improvement bootcamp" is our initiative to force ourselves to periodically step back and focus on these little big details.</p>

<h2 id="little-big-details">Little Big Details</h2>

<p>But what do we mean with “little big details”? It can be anything from natural sorting of elements in tables, consistent design of similar pages throughout the application, to friendlier wording of messages in the application.</p>

<p>Often, they're simple things. Often, they're not real “new” features. Often, you might not even know you were missing them.</p>

<p>Have you noticed how, when using Google Maps to get directions to another place, the walking man icon changes into a person with a backpack and walking sticks? Or how Spotify congratulates you on your good taste in music when you click 'Lyrics' on a song that Spotify doesn't have lyrics for?</p>

<p>It's stuff like this that makes good products even more enjoyable to use.</p>

<p>For our tool, a few of the candidates we selected for the bootcamp include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A more consistent loading/empty view of widgets around the different dashboards that CX Social offers;</li>
<li>Requiring people to type the name of the topic they want to delete;</li>
<li>Remembering the text you typed in the reply bar, so that if it fails, users can easily try again;</li>
<li>Make the "click area" of widgets bigger when selecting widgets to add to a dashboard;</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these features will win awards, nor will they ever be on the top of most requested features lists; sometimes they're just small nuisances. But they do have an impact; it's details that make the difference between a good software product and one that's actually fun to use.</p>

<h2 id="the-action-plan">The action plan</h2>

<small>Spreadsheet with the action plan</small></center></p>

<p>This was our action plan to get as much of this done, in a short timeframe, and have some fun while doing it:</p>

<ol>
<li>To start, we asked all members of the CX Social team, from Sales to Marketing, to tag improvements in our Github repository that they thought would fit the goal.</li>
<li>These were scored on a few aspects:

<ol>
<li>Priority: Indicator of how aligned the idea is with our product vision.</li>
<li>Impact: How many customers are requesting it or would benefit from it?</li>
<li>Workload: How long would it take us to implement this? (If it's expected to take longer than 4 hours, it's probably not a good candidate.)</li>
<li>Coolness: Sometimes the really fun ideas need a little bump, don't they?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The candidates were sorted according to the formula <code>(Impact * 1.5) + (Priority * 5) + (Workload * -2) + Coolness</code>. This would be the order in which we would tackle them.</li>
<li>The top 50 items in this priority list were discussed with everyone in the development team and assigned.</li>
<li>We started working on them on Wednesday morning with the goal of finishing work by Thursday evening.</li>
<li>During the coding, we kept track of our own and each other’s progress on a Github project board; indicating whenever a certain improvement was implemented, ready for review, reviewed, and ready for production.</li>
<li>On Thursday evening, we presented internally to the development team what everyone was able to accomplish.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-results">The results</h2>

<p>On Friday afternoon - our weekly beer-o'clock in the Gent office - we presented the results of the bootcamp to the whole CX Social team. In total, we were able to get 42 things done. The list included a bunch of internal improvements - thus making our support ninjas happy - and it included some longstanding customer requests.</p>

<small>Slide from the presentation to the team</small></center></p>

<p>It did take a few more days to put everything from the bootcamp into production, because we still had to hand it over to QA, prepare any customer communication, and make sure the merges happened in a coordinated way.</p>

<p>If you would argue that details and fun stuff like this should be part of the standard product and development workflow, I totally agree. And while events like this might look like "patching", they actually contribute to installing that mindset by making everyone in the team aware of the importance of these.</p>

<p>A bootcamp like this has the pleasant side effect of actually proving what we as a team are able to accomplish in a short timeframe. That feeling of speed, and accompanying pride, is a bit harder to find when you're working on bigger, long-term projects that involve lots more nuts and bolts.
Working outside of your comfort zone, by working on features in the code base you haven't seen before, or more literally, by not sitting at your desk, increased team communication and trained new team members.</p>

<p>And of course, you get to learn new stuff about your colleagues after hours. Like how passionate Gheerwijn is about analog cameras.
And that's about all the info you’ll get, because: "what happens at the bootcamp, stays at the bootcamp". Let this vague Polaroid picture of the team be a little testament to that.</p>

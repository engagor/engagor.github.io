            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/05/08/bugfixing-with-git-bisect">Bugfixing with Git Bisect</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Lately, we've deployed code that broke features, that were surely working in the past. Since we're quite heavy committers, things can get lost in our <code>git log</code> quite easily. That makes it harder to go back in history and find out what exactly caused the failure to happen. We simply would have to look through too many commits. That's where <code>git bisect</code> comes in!</p>

<p>The <code>git bisect</code> command provides us with a "binary search" over the commit history: we tell it when things were good for sure, and when they were bad, and bisect will jump to the commit that's in the middle between those two commits. We then test if things work as expected. If it was good at that point we know all history before that point was good, and we move on the the other half of history and apply the same process of dividing it in two and seeing if things work as expected. We do that until we arrive at a point where we know which commit broke things. That's where we need to look. The cool thing is that we can sift through a huge amount of commits in very few steps, and locate the problem quickly. Let's see how that works in practice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <code>git log</code> to find out the commit hash for a commit where we know that things worked. Let's assume for now that the current <code>HEAD</code> we're at is at a point where things fail.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-08-bugfixing-with-git-bisect/1.png" alt="Screenshot of a git log history" /></p></li>
<li><p>Let's start the bisect session and tell git which points were good and bad:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect start
git bisect good {the commit hash where it was good}
git bisect bad
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I didn't specify a commit hash for the <code>git bisect bad</code> command. Bisect assumes that we mean <code>HEAD</code> if we don't specify a commit. Since the current commit is bad, and <code>HEAD</code> always points to the currently checked out commit, we can leave this blank.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-08-bugfixing-with-git-bisect/2.png" alt="Screenshot of the first steps of a git bisect session" /></p></li>
<li><p>Now git will checkout a commit in the middle between our <code>good</code> and <code>bad</code> indications. Just do what you have to do to check if things work or not, e.g. run a unit test, or do some manual checks. Then pass that info on to git with <code>git bisect good</code> if things work, and <code>git bisect bad</code> if they don't.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-08-bugfixing-with-git-bisect/3.png" alt="Screenshot of a git bisect bad" /></p></li>
<li><p>Repeat <em>step 3</em> until git knows which commit went bad. It will indicate the process at every step. When it's done, git will show you the exact commit where things went from <code>good</code> to <code>bad</code>, using <code>git show</code> behind the scenes. You then know where to look to fix your problem.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-08-bugfixing-with-git-bisect/4.png" alt="Screenshot of the result of a bisect session: 1 commit" /></p></li>
</ol>

<p>To go back to master, do a simple <code>git bisect reset</code>. Congratulations! You've used <code>git bisect</code> to locate a problem in your commit history! Now, there are some more things to know:</p>

<h3 id="when-something-goes-wrong">When something goes wrong</h3>

<p>What if you did something wrong? You typed <code>git bisect bad</code> when everything was fine and you should've typed <code>git bisect good</code>? No worries! Bisect has a secret weapon: <code>git bisect log</code>, which lets you dump the history of this bisect session to a file. You can then remove the faulty step from the file with a text editor, and replay the entire session without that bad step.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Save your session to a file:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect log &gt; {filename}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Remove the faulty line from the file using your favorite text editor:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">vim {filename}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Reset your <code>bisect</code> session:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect reset
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Replay the correct steps:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect replay {filename}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Do the rest of the bisect steps to find out where things went wrong. You can remove the replay file:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">rm {filename}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="automating-the-steps-using-a-script-or-test">Automating the steps using a script or test</h3>

<p>You can automate the recursive steps of telling git that a revision is good or bad, by a simple bash script or unix command that returns a <code>0</code> status code on success, and <code>1</code> on failure. That way, if you have a testsuite, you can use that to really quickly find out where things went wrong by adding a test to it (the code is obviously not tested well or it wouldn't have happened so long ago), and using that test as the command. Let's see how that works:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">git bisect start
git bisect good {the commit hash where it was good}
git bisect bad
git bisect run {path to the script to run}
</code></pre>

<p>Don't forget to end your session with a <code>git bisect reset</code> when you found the offending commit.</p>

<h3 id="fantastic-on-fridays">Fantastic On Fridays</h3>

<p>So next time a nasty bug report comes in on a Friday -you're about to leave for a great weekend with your mates- and there were a thousand commits pushed to production that day by your team, don't dispair! Fire up <code>git bisect</code> and find where you need to be in a few minutes time, revert the commit, and enjoy your weekend!</p>

<p>Happy bughunting!</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/05/02/sliding-window-rate-limiter-redis">Building a sliding window rate limiter with Redis</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>For our Instagram crawler we needed a system to keep track of the amount of API calls we did to prevent us from hitting the rate limits. We could of course perform our HTTP requests without checking rate limits upfront, and wait until we get a <code>429 OAuthRateLimitException</code> from Instagram, but that would exhaust our tokens and block us from talking efficiently to their API.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-02-sliding-window-rate-limiter-redis/429.jpg" alt="Too many cats" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All rate limits on the Instagram Platform are controlled separately for each access token, and on a sliding 1-hour window.</p>
  
  <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/limits">Instagram API rate Limits</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're allowed to do 5000 API calls per access token each hour.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-02-sliding-window-rate-limiter-redis/slidingwindow.png" alt="Sliding window ratelimiting visualisation" /></p>

<p>Every point on the axis represents an API call. The sliding window is an hour in this case. Every time we do an API call we add the timestamp (in microseconds) of the API call to a list. In pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code class="js">timestamps.push(Date.now());
</code></pre>

<p>When we're about to do an API call in our crawler we need to check if we're allowed to do one:</p>

<ol>
<li>How many calls did we do in the last hour?</li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="js">callsInTheLastHour = timestamps.filter(timestamp =&gt; timestamp &gt; now - slidingWindow);
count = callsInTheLastHour.length
</code></pre>

<ol start="2">
<li>How many can we still do?</li>
</ol>

<p>After we calculated the amount of API calls we did in the last hour we can calculate the remaining API calls:</p>

<pre><code class="js">remaining = maxCallsPerHour - count;
</code></pre>

<p>Let's say we did <code>4413</code> API calls in the last hour then we're allowed to do <code>587</code> more at this moment.</p>

<p>Great, we got our algorithm. Now we need some kind of database to store a list of timestamps grouped per access token. Maybe we could use MySQL or PostgreSQL? Yes, we could but then we would need a system that periodically removes outdated timestamps since neither MySQL or PostgreSQL allow us to set a time to life on a row. What about <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcached</a>? Yes, that's also an option. Sadly Memcached doesn't have the concept of an array or list (we could serialize an array using our favourite programming language). We can do better. What about <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>? Yes, I like where this is going. Redis is a key/value store that supports lists, sets, sorted sets and more.</p>

<p>We're ready to translate our algorithm to Redis commands. Assuming you already have Redis installed, start a server: <code>$ redis-server</code>. If you're on a mac, you can just <code>$ brew install redis</code> to get it.</p>

<p>We're going to use a <a href="https://redis.io/commands/#sorted_set">sorted set</a> to hold our timestamps because it fits our needs.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; MULTI
&gt; ZREMRANGEBYSCORE $accessToken 0 ($now - $slidingWindow)
&gt; ZRANGE $accessToken 0 -1
&gt; ZADD $accessToken $now $now
&gt; EXPIRE $accessToken $slidingWindow
&gt; EXEC
</code></pre>

<p>Let's break it down:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>MULTI</code> to mark the start of a transaction block. Subsequent commands will be queued for atomic execution using <code>EXEC</code>.</li>
<li><code>ZREMRANGEBYSCORE $accessToken 0 ($now - $slidingWindow)</code> to remove API call timestamps that were done before the start of the window.</li>
<li><code>ZRANGE $accessToken 0 -1</code> to get a list of all API call timestamps that happened during the window.</li>
<li><code>ZADD $accessToken $now $now</code> to add a log for the current API call that we're about to do.</li>
<li><code>EXPIRE $accessToken $slidingWindow</code> to reset the expiry date for this sorted set of timestamps (for the current OAuth Token).</li>
<li><code>EXEC</code> will execute all previously queued commands and restore the connection state to normal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of using the actual OAuth access tokens (and duplicating them to Redis), you might want to use an identifier or hash of the token instead as <code>$accessToken</code>. It serves as the key for our Redis sorted set. Also note that, in the same transaction as reading the list of timestamps, we <em>add</em> a new timestamp to the list (the <code>ZADD</code> command). We do this because this is being used in a distributed context (we have many workers performing API calls), and we don't want to write when we already exceeded our limits.</p>

<p>In PHP this might look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">// composer require predis/predis
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$maxCallsPerHour = 5000;
$slidingWindow = 3600;

$now = microtime(true);
$accessToken = md5('access-token');

$client = new Predis\Client();
$client-&gt;multi();
$client-&gt;zrangebyscore($accessToken, 0, $now - $slidingWindow);
$client-&gt;zrange($accessToken, 0, -1);
$client-&gt;zadd($accessToken, $now, $now);
$client-&gt;expire($accessToken, $slidingWindow);
$result = $client-&gt;exec();

// The second command inside the transaction was ZRANGE,
// which returns a list of timestamps within the last hour.
$timestamps = $result[1];

$remaining = max(0, $maxCallsPerHour - count($timestamps));

if ($remaining &gt; 0) {
    echo sprintf('%s: Allowed and %d remaining', $now, $remaining) . PHP_EOL;
} else {
    echo sprintf('%s: Not allowed', $now) . PHP_EOL;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To conclude all of this, and to make this work within our codebase, we put this all nicely in a class, behind an interface <code>RateLimiter</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace CXSocial\RateLimiter;

interface RateLimiter
{
    /**
     * Request the remaining ratelimit points
     *
     * @param RateLimitedResource $rateLimitedResource
     *
     * @throws SorryRateLimitUnavailable
     *
     * @return int
     */
    public function remaining(RateLimitedResource $rateLimitedResource);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows us to write code that doesn't couple to implemention too much. This has been working like a charm for us! We're huge fans.</p>

<p>As developers we use Git <strong>a lot</strong>. I mean the whole time.</p>

  <p>Why did I do that?</p>

<p>I wouldn't know how to work without git anymore, and it has also found its way into my "IDE" workflow, even though I used it "purely" from the cli for a long time. Let's see how to work with git from Vim. I'm assuming you have the git binary installed on your system.</p>

<h2 id="seeing-what-changed-in-the-current-file">Seeing what changed in the current file</h2>

<p>There's this neat little plugin called <a href="https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter">GitGutter</a>, which just shows you the classic <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> signs next to added and deleted code in open files. As an added bonus, it lets you jump between changed blocks of code within a file, using the <code>:GitGutterNextHunk</code> and <code>:GitGutterPrevHunk</code> commands, which you can bind to a key in your <code>.vimrc</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">" Hop from gitgutter hunk to hunk
nmap &lt;Leader&gt;v :GitGutterNextHunk&lt;CR&gt;
nmap &lt;Leader&gt;b :GitGutterPrevHunk&lt;CR&gt;

<h2 id="the-real-deal">The Real Deal</h2>

<p>Using git from Vim couldn't be more intuitive (and powerful) than with <a href="http://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">Fugitive</a>. I do everything from Vim now.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-i-do-that%3F-%60%3Agblame%60">Why did I do that? <code>:Gblame</code></h3>

<p>Using the Fugitive <code>:Gblame</code> command, you quickly annotate the current file with <code>git blame</code> information, which lets you jump through history. From the annotation, you can just press <code>Enter</code> and see the complete commit in which that line was changed. From that commit view, you can again use <code>Enter</code> to dive in the history of that file even further, until you found what you were looking for.</p>

<h3 id="what-am-i-doing%3F-%60%3Agstatus%60">What am I doing? <code>:Gstatus</code></h3>

<p>The <code>:Gstatus</code> command opens a split window in Vim, which is an interactive wrapper around the output of <code>git status</code>. From there, you can jump between files in the list using <code>&lt;C-n&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;C-p&gt;</code>, press <code>Enter</code> to open the file under cursor, and use <code>-</code> to <code>git add</code> files or <code>git reset</code> them. You can also press <code>p</code> to <code>git add --patch</code> them and see what you're doing. When you're done, you can press <code>C</code> to commit.</p>

<h3 id="the-rest-of-git">The rest of git</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fugitive has <strong>really</strong> extensive support for resolving merge conflicts and diffing files, using Vim's built-in diff view. Here's some <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/fugitive-vim-resolving-merge-conflicts-with-vimdiff/">great info about how that works</a>.</li>
<li>There's the <strong>great</strong> <code>:Gbrowse</code>, which opens the current file on GitHub (or other configurable host), and you can even use a Vim Visual mode selection and use <code>:Gbrowse</code> to directly link to those lines on GitHub.</li>
<li>There's a proxy command called <code>:Git</code> which just proxies everything to the command line git. This means you can <code>:Git pull</code> and other commands, just like you used to.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hotkeys">Hotkeys</h2>

<p>I created some hotkeys in <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">" Git leader hotkeys
nmap &lt;Leader&gt;gs :Gstatus&lt;CR&gt;
nmap &lt;Leader&gt;gc :Gcommit&lt;CR&gt;
nmap &lt;Leader&gt;gb :Gblame&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>That's it really, super easy integration of git. Of course you could e.g. also integrate your current branch into your Vim statusline. Just check Fugitive's documentation! I don't feel the need for that, as I <code>:Gstatus</code> practically the whole time, and as a result, I see which branch I'm on the whole time!

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/10/02/vim-ide-debugging">Vim As A PHP IDE - Debugging</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p><strong>This blogpost is part of the "Vim As A PHP IDE" series, which starts <a href="/blog/2017/01/01/vim-ide-setting-up">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I ended the "Vim As A PHP IDE" series with the <a href="/blog/2017/06/15/vim-ide-refactoring">refactoring</a> post. However, there's a huge thing missing from this series, and that's debugging. A lot of people debug their code using <code>var_dump</code> and <code>echo</code>, or worse, with self-made methods to markup the things they want to dump. Not only is this very old-school, there are also problems with this method. For instance, the dumped code affects the behaviour or the output of the running script. This is where the step debugger comes in.</p>

<p>A step debugger lets you step trough your code while it's running, so that you can inspect variables on the fly. This eliminates the need for dumping lines to the standard output, while giving you more insight in what's happening. e.g. you can see the whole stack trace and step through that as well...</p>

<p><a href="/images/2017-10-02-vim-ide-debugging/1.png"><img src="/images/2017-10-02-vim-ide-debugging/1.png" alt="screenshot of Vdebug in action" /></a></p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-work%3F">How does this work?</h2>

<p>Basically, the debugger, in the case of PHP <a href="https://xdebug.org/">xdebug</a>, hooks into the running code and exposes an API that you can use to set breakpoints, make the compiler run, etc... To install xdebug, follow the instructions on <a href="https://xdebug.org/docs/install">their documentation page</a>. Now you'll also have to add some lines to your <code>php.ini</code> configuration file. In my case it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ini">[xdebug]
zend_extension="/path/to/xdebug.so"
xdebug.remote_enable=1
</code></pre>

<p>The important part is the <code>remote_enable=1</code>, which allows us to hook into the step debugger.</p>

<p>Then you, as a user, sets a breakpoint somewhere and inspects the state of the program at that point, using a "client" that knows how to speak the language of the debugger's API and integrates with your IDE. In our case that client is going to be the Vim plugin <a href="https://github.com/joonty/vdebug/">Vdebug</a>. You can install the plugin using your favorite plugin installation method.</p>

<h2 id="debugging-our-first-script">Debugging our first script</h2>

<p>Let's create a script <code>test.php</code> that we want to debug:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$foo = 'bar';
$foo = 'baz';
</code></pre>

<p>We want to see what's inside the <code>$foo</code> variable during the time this script runs. In Vim, press <code>F5</code> to activate Vdebug. Now, run the script with debugging enabled:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">XDEBUG_CONFIG="idekey=xdebug" php test.php
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice that the script seems to hang. In Vim, however, you'll see something like this happening:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-10-02-vim-ide-debugging/2.png" alt="Vdebug first startup screen" /></p>

<p>That's right! A new tab opened in Vim, containing the Vdebug window with the first breakpoint active. You can instantly see the local variables on the right, as well as the stack trace. If we now move our cursor to line <code>4</code> and press <code>F9</code>, to make the debugger run to that line and inspect the state right before it, we'll see that the <code>$foo</code> variable's value was changed to <code>'bar'</code>. Look ma, no <code>var_dump</code>!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-10-02-vim-ide-debugging/3.png" alt="Inspecting the $foo variable in Vdebug" /></p>

<p>You can also see the superglobals by hitting that tab in the variables screen:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-10-02-vim-ide-debugging/4.png" alt="Vdebug shows PHPs superglobals at this point in time" /></p>

<p>Great! Now you know the basics. Take a look at the other things you can do while debugging (stepping out, stepping over, etc) with Vdebug on <a href="https://github.com/joonty/vdebug/#quick-guide">their documentation's Quick Guide section</a>. To quickly stop debugging and return to where you were before, press <code>F6</code> twice.</p>

<p>Tip: if you don't want to set the environment variable every time, you can make XDebug try and run a remote debugger session all the time, and hook into it when you want to by enabling your client. Put this extra line in your <code>php.ini</code> configuration file:</p>

<pre><code class="ini">xdebug.remote_autostart=1
</code></pre>

<h2 id="debugging-code-that-is-run-by-a-webserver">Debugging code that is run by a webserver</h2>

<p>Running the debugger for web requests is also possible. If the webserver is running on your local machine, you don't have to change much (assuming XDebug is installed and configured as above): just append a parameter to your URL, like this <code>XDEBUG_SESSION_START=xdebug</code>. For instance, <code>https://foo.local/test.php</code> would become <code>https://foo.local/test.php?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=xdebug</code>. The debugger will now try to connect to your client!</p>

<p>So hereby we conclude this blog series about Vim as an IDE once more, and we hope that you liked it! Happy Debugging!</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/09/27/internship-webhooks-api">Real-Time Webhooks API: Secure an Internship with us</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Are you a student looking for an internship for Spring 2018? We have a project involving real-time API's and webhooks that you might find interesting. Read on to know what we do here at Clarabrige Engage and what the project is about.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-do%3F">What do we do?</h2>

<p>The Clarabrige Engage team builds a customer care tool for social media. Our clients use our software to be able to respond to the incoming questions and complaints on their Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, Instagram profiles, a.o. These clients often have a high volume of messages, on several social profiles. We try to make those people’s lives easier by offering automation tools, smart routing of messages and reply suggestions, among others.
<a href="https://developers.engagor.com/team">Read more about what we do</a>.</p>

<p>As of February 2018, we have room for one or more enthusiastic interns to join us for (at least) a couple of weeks <em>(preferably 4 days a week, any time between February 2017 to June 2018)</em>, to work as part of the Clarabrige Engage development team.
As an intern you are an integral part of the R&amp;D team working on different parts of the application using technologies like PHP, React, MySQL, Redis, memcached, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ, a.o. The team consists of a designer, front-end developer, data scientist, and several system engineers &amp; full-stack web developers.
We are looking for a student with interest and knowledge of mainly back-end technologies, and some front-end knowledge.</p>

<p>Want to know more about what it’s like to do an internship here? Read about <a href="https://engagor.github.io/blog/2017/06/01/internship-gheerwijn-cx-social-developer/">Gheerwijn’s experiences</a> or the <a href="https://engagor.github.io/blog/2017/06/30/internship-achievements/">Achievements project intern Cedric is currently working on</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-project%3A-webhooks-api">The Project: Webhooks API</h2>

<p>Clarabrige Engage has a Rest (oAuth JSON) API used by several of our clients. Its documentation is publicly available on our <a href="https://developers.engagor.com">developer site</a> so have a look to see what’s possible with it.<br />
Its uses include displaying important social profile metrics on own websites, two-way syncing of data from the Clarabrige Engage CRM to other (in-house or 3rd party) CRM’s (like Salesforce, a.o.). It’s also being used to display curated social mentions on own sites, or to combine data from Clarabrige Engage with data from other tools on internal dashboards.</p>

<p>Today, the API is used in a <code>PULL</code> model only, where clients (periodically) request information from our API. This internship project involves a significant update to allow <code>PUSH</code> webhooks to be send to our clients.<br />
Clients have been requesting this feature, and are eager to start using it, to be notified of new data (e.g. new tweets), or updates to data (e.g. when a certain social contact’s information is filled in) in real-time.
The project would take inspiration from the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks">Facebook Webhooks API</a>, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/webhooks">Twitter Webhooks API</a>, or <a href="https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/outgoing-webhooks">Slack’s Outgoing Webhooks API</a> and take into account other <a href="https://restful.io/webhooks-dos-and-dont-s-what-we-learned-after-integrating-100-apis-d567405a3671">common do's and don'ts regarding webhooks</a>.</p>

<p>It consists of the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating &amp; updating webhook-subscriptions (defining which webhooks should be delivered where). 

<ul>
<li>This should be possible via an API, as well as a web-interface;</li>
<li>Configured delivery URL’s should be checked for ownership by verification with configured handshake;</li>
<li>Configured delivery URL’s should be checked for validity of their SSL certificates;</li>
<li>Several types of subscriptions will be needed (i.e. subscribing to “account” updates, and subscribing to “user” updates);</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A robust webhook delivery system, consisting of:

<ul>
<li>Re-delivery when the delivery URL’s is unresponsive;</li>
<li>Trying to guarantee exactly-once delivery;</li>
<li>Signed webhook payloads, so receivers can verify the origin of the request;</li>
<li>Notifying the API user via email when their delivery URL continues to be unresponsive;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implementing the event-log that eventually triggers the webhooks:

<ul>
<li>Making sure changes in the Clarabrige Engage code base trigger an event to the webhooks system;</li>
<li>Distribution of events to the right subscriptions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Monitoring of the system to:

<ul>
<li>Be alerted when webhook delivery is running behind.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</center></p>

<p>Together with the Clarabrige Engage development team, you as an intern are responsible for choosing the right technologies &amp; architecture. For those interested in backend technologies, this will be an exciting project, that you can help shape, build and deploy to production.</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/09/22/using-decorators-for-debugging">Using decorators for debugging</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>When you're writing SOLID code, you probably hide some implementation details behind interfaces in many parts of your codebase. In this post, we'll talk about an HTTP client, which is hidden behind an interface. The exact implementation we use doesn't matter. It could be a simple cURL call, or we could be using a more advance package like <a href="https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/">Guzzle</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kriswallsmith/Buzz">Buzz</a>. In any case, our application knows only about the <code>HttpClient</code> interface that it defined, like this.</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace CoffeeRun;

interface HttpClient
{
    /**
     * @param Request $request An HTTP Request
     *
     * @throws ClientException if the request failed
     *
     * @return Response a response instance
     */
    public function execute(Request $request): Response;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our code will ask the <code>HttpClient</code> implementation to <code>execute()</code> a <code>Request</code> and expects a <code>Response</code> if the call succeeded, or a <code>ClientException</code> if something unexpected happens.</p>

<p>The cool thing about this, is that our whole codebase needs to only know about this one interface, and not about the specific package that we're going to use. Plus, we can use another (fake) implementation of the <code>HttpClient</code> interface during testing.</p>

<h2 id="decorators">Decorators</h2>

<p>Now let's say that we want our application to make all HTTP calls with a certain User-Agent header. We don't want to go into our code and change every occurrence of <code>new Request</code> to also include that specific header. This is where decorators come in. We can "wrap" the <code>HttpClient</code> instance in a shell that acts as if it's the original <code>HttpClient</code>, but just takes the incoming <code>Request</code> and adds that header to it, and then passes on the call to the wrapped <code>HttpClient</code>. Like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace CoffeeRun;

final class ClientWithUserAgent implements HttpClient
{
    private $wrappedClient;
    private $userAgentString;

    public function __construct(HttpClient $wrappedClient, $userAgentString = 'Coffee Bot 1.0')
    {
        $this-&gt;wrappedClient = $wrappedClient;
        $this-&gt;userAgentString = (string) $userAgentString;
    }

    public function execute(Request $request): Response
    {
        $request = $request-&gt;withHeader('User-Agent', $this-&gt;userAgentString);

        return $this-&gt;wrappedClient-&gt;execute($request);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Creating an instance looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$httpClient = new ClientWithUserAgent(
    new ClientCurl(),
    'ROBOCOP'

<p>As this Decorator also implements the same <code>HttpClient</code> interface, the application doesn't even know this is happening, because from the outside it looks and behaves exactly the same. This change essentially now is a change in the configuration file of our Dependency Injection Container, no other files needed to be changed to make this happen.</p>

<h2 id="using-decorators-for-investigation">Using decorators for investigation</h2>

<p>Now, if we want to investigate the requests and responses that we get from a service while the application is running, e.g. when an unidentified bug is happening, we could do it with a decorator. The rest of the application won't know about it and should just keep on working as usual, while we get logs of the data that we want:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace CoffeeRun;

final class LoggingClient implements HttpClient
{
    private $wrappedClient;
    private $logger;

    public function __construct(HttpClient $wrappedClient, LoggerInterface $logger)
    {
        $this-&gt;wrappedClient = $wrappedClient;
        $this-&gt;logger = $logger;
    }

    public function execute(Request $request): Response
    {
        $this-&gt;logger-&gt;debug('request', $request);

        $response = $this-&gt;wrappedClient-&gt;execute($request);

        $this-&gt;logger-&gt;debug('response', $response);

        return $response;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The request and response are logged in our logs now, and they look good to us, but we still haven't found what we're looking for and we want to see if the requests our app is making work from the command line using <code>curl</code>. What if we made our application also log the complete curl commands? Then we could just copy paste them in our terminal to test them locally.</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace CoffeeRun;

final class CurlCommandLoggingClient implements HttpClient
{
    private $wrappedClient;
    private $logger;

    public function __construct(HttpClient $wrappedClient, LoggerInterface $logger)
    {
        $this-&gt;wrappedClient = $wrappedClient;
        $this-&gt;logger = $logger;
    }

    public function execute(Request $request): Response
    {
        $method = $request-&gt;getMethod();
        $url = $request-&gt;getUrl();
        $params = $request-&gt;getParams();
        $headers = $request-&gt;getHeaders();

        $curlString = 'curl';
        $curlString .= ' --' . strtolower($method);

        foreach ($params as $key =&gt; $value) {
            $curlString .= ' --data "' . $key . '=' . $value . '"';
        }

        foreach ($headers as $key =&gt; $value) {
            $curlString .= ' --header "' . $key . '=' . $value . '"';
        }

        $curlString .= ' "' . $url . '"';

        $this-&gt;logger-&gt;debug('curl command', $curlString);

        return $this-&gt;client-&gt;execute($request);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this is an oversimplified way of building the <code>curl</code> command, but this will help you debug your HTTP calls by copy/pasting them to your terminal! Easy as that, and still no changes to the existing code. It takes one line to change it, and one line to delete and bring it back to production values.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>

<ul>
<li>Liskov Substition Principle: It's very important that our decorators still adhere to the original contract of the wrapped instance (in this case the <code>HttpClient</code> interface). If the decorator would produce another return value, or take different method parameters, it wouldn't work.</li>
<li>Applying a decorator that logs a lot of data in production might have an impact on your host. This is just an example of using your existing interfaces to create some plug &amp; play debugging solutions. If you do something like this in production, use the same caution as with other changes in production.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it! Have fun.</p>

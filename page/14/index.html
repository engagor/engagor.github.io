        </header>
        <div>
            <h2 id="what-is-perceived-performance%3F">What is perceived performance?</h2>

<p>Perceived performance refers to how fast a user thinks your site is, rather than the actual site speed. It's a metric measured by humans rather than a site speed test tool. How fast does the website feel? For example, Facebook appears faster by loading a placeholder for posts in the News Feed. It's useful to know that a site is only loading rather than functioning slowly.</p>

<h2 id="how-clarabrige-engage-handles-perceived-performance">How Clarabrige Engage Handles Perceived Performance</h2>

<p>Clarabrige Engage is a large application that has a complex interface. The "inbox" part of our system has multiple small features, that all appear to be on a single page. The perceived performance of the inbox is more important than the actual speed, especially because it provides a seamless user experience. The following are a few things we do to portray a speedier performance!</p>

<h2 id="when-a-mention-is-resolved">When a mention is resolved</h2>

<p>In Clarabrige Engage we process small pieces of information we call "mentions". A mention is any blog post, news article, tweet, etc. that matches any of your specified criteria. All mentions are refined into the Clarabrige Engage inbox, where support agents can mark them as <em>resolved</em> when they are replied to/labelled as no action needed, etc. When a mention is <em>resolved</em> the support agent is automatically shown the next <em>mention</em> to attend to.
When a mention is resolved we manipulate the DOM and remove the element <em>before</em> the request is completed successfully. This gives you the impression that your action is completed instantly. In the rare case that the request fails, we replace the DOM element and display a relevant error message, so that the user knows what's going on and can resolve the mention again.</p>

<small>Resolving a mention in Clarabrige Engage Inbox</small>
</center></p>

<h2 id="loading-indicators">Loading Indicators</h2>

<p>Loading icons can become a bit annoying on snappy pages because you see a flickering behaviour, and it makes the user feel as though they have to unnecessarily <em>wait</em>. Snappy pages don't require a loading icon, but we'd like a back up plan in case the page takes longer than expected to load. In this case, we use a timeout function for the loading functionality, and only show the loading interface when the request takes over X milliseconds to complete.</p>

<p><center>
<img src="/images/2017-07-10-perceived-performance/delayloading.gif" alt="Delay loading" /><br />
<small>Don't show a loading indicator for quick requests</small>
</center></p>

<p>In this instance, there's a 3000 millisecond delay on the loading behaviour for this page.</p>

<p><center>
<img src="/images/2017-07-10-perceived-performance/delayloadingspinner.gif" alt="Delay loading" /><br />
<small>Do show a loading indicator when a request is taking longer than usual</small>
</center></p>

<h2 id="placeholder-mentions-in-inbox">Placeholder mentions in inbox</h2>

<p>Similar to how Facebook shows a preview of your feed by showing mini placeholders for each post, we show a placeholder when loading a list of mentions in Clarabrige Engage. 
We immediately show the selected mention, but for other mentions in the thread we automatically show a mention placeholder while they're loading. Then when the user scrolls farther in the thread, we pop in the next mentions. This gives structure to the page, while data is loading and thus makes it easier for the eye/mind to prepare for that data to be there.</p>

<p><center>
<img src="/images/2017-07-10-perceived-performance/inboxloading.gif" alt="Loading of inbox" /><br />
<small>Placeholder sections for mentions in the Clarabrige Engage inbox</small>
</center></p>

<h2 id="additional-information-in-dropdowns%2Fpopups">Additional information in dropdowns/popups</h2>

<p>When you display a popup or dropdown there's no need to fetch every piece of information immediately. On each Twitter mention we have a "following" dropdown which shows the list of profiles that is following the author of the mention. It also shows whether you are following <em>that</em> profile and if <em>that</em> profile is following <em>you</em>. However we only load the latter information when the dropdown is opened. Sometimes we hit Twitter rate limits, and still try to display relevant following info based on our cache. If we don't have any info, we will still show the dropdown with ability to follow someone (but without displaying who they're already following) since those two endpoints have separate rate limits.</p>

<p><center>
<img src="/images/2017-07-10-perceived-performance/twitterfollowers.gif" alt="Loading of Twitter Followers" /><br />
<small>Dropdown that shows if you are following the author of a mention and vice versa</small>
</center></p>

<h2 id="loading-new-content-without-a-page-reload">Loading new content without a page reload</h2>

<p>We have a large sidebar in Clarabrige Engage for navigation, as well as a top menu bar. When switching between pages, we just request the content for the main part of the page, and insert the new main content. This saves us doing a full page load.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Have you implemented any features to improve perceived performance? We'd love to hear about it!</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-do%3F">What do we do?</h2>

<p>The Clarabrige Engage team builds a customer care tool for social media. Our clients use our software to be able to respond to the incoming questions and complaints on their Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, Instagram profiles, a.o. These clients often have a high volume of messages, on several social profiles. We try to make those people’s lives easier by offering automation tools, smart routing of messages and reply suggestions, among others.<br />
<a href="https://developers.engagor.com/team">Read more about what we do</a>.</p>

<p>As of September 2017, we have room for one or more enthusiastic interns to join us for (at least) a couple of weeks <em>(preferably 4 days a week, any time between September 2017 to June 2018)</em>, to work as part of the Clarabrige Engage development team. As an intern you are an integral part of the R&amp;D team working on different parts of the application using technologies like PHP, React, MySQL, Redis, memcached, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, a.o. The other team members include a designer, front-end developer, data scientist, and several system engineers &amp; full-stack web developers.<br />
We are looking for a student with interest and knowledge of both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>

<p>Want to hear from a previous intern what it’s like to join our team? Read about <a href="https://engagor.github.io/blog/2017/06/01/internship-gheerwijn-cx-social-developer/">Gheerwijn’s experiences</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-project%3A-achievements%21">The Project: Achievements!</h2>

<p>A big percentage of users work in our customer care tool full time, day-in day-out. So it’s important for us to keep the user experience for them smooth and enjoyable. We want to make the experience more fun by developing an achievement based system in the web-application.</p>

<p>Apart from making Clarabrige Engage more fun for agents to work in, we aim to improve team work, increase retention and let users discover new features.</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2017/06/15/vim-ide-refactoring">Vim As A PHP IDE - Refactoring</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p><strong>This blogpost is part of the "Vim As A PHP IDE" series, which starts <a href="/blog/2017/01/01/vim-ide-setting-up">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I kept the best for last. The feature I get the most questions about is the refactoring capabilities of IDEs. While Vim has some great features that most IDEs don't have, it certainly is true that this is one of the features that Vim is not really that good at. Or is it? In any case, it's good enough at it for me. Let's see what we got.</p>

<h2 id="how-would-you-do-it-from-the-cli%3F">How would you do it from the cli?</h2>

<p>Basically, if some functionality is not in Vim by default, there are two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a command line tool that already does the job - this is how Vim fits into the UNIX philosophy.</li>
<li>Use Vimscript to program the functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily, there's this neat tool called <a href="https://github.com/QafooLabs/php-refactoring-browser/">PHP Refactoring Browser</a>, that already knows how to do some PHP refactorings from the command line.</p>

<ul>
<li>extract method;</li>
<li>rename local variable;</li>
<li>local variable to instance variable;</li>
<li>optimise use statements;</li>
</ul>

<p>The tool is also open source, so we can add missing refactorings in the future. The tool is standing on the shoulders of giants like <a href="https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser">PHP Parser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Andrewsville/PHP-Token-Reflection">PHP Token Reflection</a>. But doing this from the command line isn't that great...</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/refactoring-browser.png" alt="Running the Refactoring Browser from the command line" /></p>

<h2 id="vim-integration">Vim integration</h2>

<p>Of course, some people already thought this was useful for Vim people, and created <a href="https://github.com/vim-php/vim-php-refactoring">a plugin</a> to wrap the command line tool. I'm assuming you installed the command line tool in <code>/usr/local/bin/refactor.phar</code>. Install the plugin using your favorite Vim package manager, and put this line in your <code>.vimrc</code> to let the plugin know where to look for the executable:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">" PHP refactoring browser
let g:php_refactor_command='/usr/local/bin/refactor.phar'
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/refactoring-in-vim.png" alt="Running the Refactoring Browser from within Vim" /></p>

<p>You can now do these basic refactorings using their hotkey <code>&lt;Leader&gt;r</code> and selecting your desired refactoring from the list. That's nice, but there are some refactorings missing that we'd like, e.g. "Extract Interface".</p>

<h2 id="creating-refactorings-with-vimscript">Creating refactorings with Vimscript</h2>

<p>While the best solution would definitely be to contribute to the PHP Refactoring Browser, we want to have this functionality right now. Let's create the "Extract Interface" refactoring in Vimscript. I'd like to select some class methods using linewise <code>VISUAL</code> mode, issue a command on it, fill in the name of the Interface that I'd like the methods be extracted to, and have the current class implement that method. Let's see what we got:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">command! -range PhpExtractInterfaceFromRange &lt;line1&gt;,&lt;line2&gt;call PhpInterfaceFromRange()

function! PhpInterfaceFromRange() range
  let interface = input('Enter extracted interface name: ')
  call PhpExtractInterface(a:firstline, a:lastline, interface)
endfunction

function! PhpExtractInterface(start, end, interface)
  normal! qkq
  execute ''.a:start.','.a:end.'g/public.*function.*(\_.\{-})/normal ^f(V%"Ky'
  let @k = substitute(@k, ' \?{', '', 'g')
  let @k = substitute(@k, ')', ');', 'g')
  ?class
  execute "normal! A implements ".a:interface
  execute "normal! Ointerface ".a:interface
  execute "normal! o{\&lt;CR&gt;}\&lt;CR&gt;"
  normal! k"kP
  normal! dd
endfunction
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>We create a command, called <code>PhpExtractInterfaceFromRange</code> which can be called with a Vim range (like <code>10,50</code>, or from a <code>VISUAL</code> select). If the command is issued, it calls a Vimscript function with the name <code>PhpInterfaceFromRange()</code></li>
<li>The <code>PhpInterfaceFromRange()</code> function asks the user how they want to call their new interface, and passes the range and the name of that interface to <code>PhpExtractInterface()</code></li>
<li>Here's where the real magic happens. We clear register <code>k</code>, and search for all public method definitions in the specified range. We then append every definition to the <code>k</code> register. We then remove curly braces <code>{}</code> and put the missing <code>;</code> after every method definition. We search for the start of the current class, and make it implement the interface. We then create the interface with the contents of the register <code>k</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/extract-interface-1.png" alt="Extracting an interface from a class with one method selected in Visual Mode" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/extract-interface-2.png" alt="Interface was extracted successfully" /></p>

<p><strong>Wow</strong></p>

<p>Since this is now a command, it could easily be assigned a <code>&lt;Leader&gt;</code> hotkey for visual mode selects, for instance. And you could easily do the same thing for e.g. "Extract Class".</p>

<p>Now, I created this in half an hour, and it's perfectly usable in most use cases, but it's not perfect. As this is the only refactoring I really missed from the Refactoring Browser, I'll just use this until a real refactoring gets integrated in the real plugin. There are plugins with some more Vimscript implementations of refactorings, like <a href="https://github.com/adoy/vim-php-refactoring-toolbox">this one</a>. Keep in mind that they will be susceptible to mistakes, as they don't <em>really</em> understand your PHP code like the Refactoring Browser does.</p>

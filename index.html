            <h1><a href="/blog/2019/10/29/some-pairing-and-mobbing-take-aways">Some Pairing and Mobbing takeaways</a></h1>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>As you could already read in <a href="/blog/2018/12/07/one-month-of-pairing">one of our previous posts</a>, we started working in pairs some time ago. Now there's also some Mob Programming being done from time to time, and we started automatically doing some things to make our own lives easier. Some examples:</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%9B%8B-%F0%9F%93%BA-make-yourself-comfortable">üõã üì∫ Make yourself comfortable</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2019-11-29-some-pairing-and-mobbing-take-aways/mobbing-team.jpg" alt="Keyboard Switcher in macOS" /></p>

<p>Make sure everyone has a good chair and good visibility of the screen you're working on. If you're pairing, this means that you should work on an external screen of some kind, instead of on a laptop. Make sure there's enough light, not too much noise, and that everyone has drinks and food if they need it.</p>

<p>You can work best if you're not focussing on something else. Taking away small distractions like restlessness or poor visibility of the screen can do wonders!</p>

<h2 id="%E2%8C%A8%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%92%BB-set-your-machine-up-for-everyone">‚å®Ô∏èüíª Set your machine up for everyone</h2>

<p>Make sure the machine you're working on is set up so that you can switch drivers often and so that every driver is working comfortably on it. Of course, it's mostly impossible to all agree on the same set of shortcuts and keyboard setups, but we found a great compromise:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-11-29-some-pairing-and-mobbing-take-aways/keyboard-switcher.png" alt="Keyboard Switcher in macOS" /></p>

<ul>
<li>On macOS you can make the keyboard settings available from the top bar so that you can really quickly switch keyboard layouts</li>
<li>In PhpStorm or other editors, there are options to export your settings and import other ones. I just created a backup of my settings by exporting them and I ask everyone at the beginning of the session to send me their configs. When they start, they can select their own config from my desktop! After the session I can easily restore my own settings.</li>
<li>On macOS it's also possible to connect multiple Bluetooth keyboards, mice, etc. We have an AZERTY and a QUERTY keyboard available, as well as a trackpad and a mouse. They are easily passed on and ready to use by the next driver!</li>
</ul>

<p>These three small changes come a long way to make you feel as if you're working on your own machine!</p>

<h2 id="%E2%9B%94%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%93%B1-only-allow-one-screen">‚õîÔ∏èüì± Only allow one screen</h2>

<p>Being distracted already came up in the previous tip, but here we go again! Ask everyone in the room to put their phones on silent and put them in their pockets. Ask them to close their laptops, they're not going to need them. If you need to look something up, or if you're unsure about what a given piece of code does, ask the driver to put it on the big screen.</p>

<p>This way, nobody dives off into their own cocoon and let their minds escape the group's focus.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%8E%A8%E2%97%BB%EF%B8%8F--to-the-drawing-board">üé®‚óªÔ∏è  To the drawing board</h2>

<p>Try to find a way to make things visible. If you have a whiteboard available, great! Do you have a wall? Use stickies or put up big pieces of paper. As a last resort, there's still just pieces of paper that you can draw on. Just make sure that you can make something visible so that you have something to talk about when a discussion is in order.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%98%B0-%E2%9E%A1-%F0%9F%98%81-keeping-everyone-engaged">üò∞ ‚û° üòÅ Keeping everyone engaged</h2>

<p>Two rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Switch drivers often</li>
<li>Take breaks often</li>
</ul>

<p>We use <a href="http://mobster.cc/">this simple app</a> to notify us when to switch and when to take breaks. If the app doesn't tell you to take a break but you feel like it anyway, just do it. You'll be more productive after the break.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%92%BB%F0%9F%8F%A1-remote-work-and-mobbing">üíªüè° Remote work and mobbing</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make sure both parties have a perfect internet connection</li>
<li>Make sure the setup for audio is working properly. We use a Jabra kit that picks up less ambient noise and makes everything clear to understand</li>
<li>Use e.g. Slack screen sharing features to your advantage: you can draw on the screen and you can switch drivers easily!</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope these takeaways can help you as well! Happy Mobbing!</p>

            <p>Starting tomorrow until October 20th, it's <a href="https://codeweek.eu/">EU Code Week 2019</a>; that time of year to get young adults excited about programming.<br />
Just as last year, several members of our team are taking part in one of the initiatives for that European Code Week; we'll be giving a workshop to 11 year olds by building a little robot with them next Thursday.<br />
This blog post puts a spotlight on these initiatives and explains how you can help.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%87%AA%F0%9F%87%BA-european-code-week">üá™üá∫ European Code Week</h2>

<p>During 15 days <a href="https://codeweek.eu/events">hundreds of activities</a> happen all over Europe that want to celebrate creativity, problem solving and collaboration through programming and other tech activities.</p>

<p>You probably need little convincing that digital literacy is super important in today's world. Getting young adults interested in programming is one way of driving that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It's about Pia, who felt like she had to study law, even though she always enjoyed maths and playing with computers. It's about Alice, who dreams about making robots because her parents don't allow her to have a cat." - <a href="https://codeweek.eu/about">codeweek.eu/about</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The initiative started in 2013 and had grown to 44000 activities reaching 2.7 million people all over Europe by last year, all run by volunteers. The EU Code Week includes a.o. well-known initiatives like CoderDojo.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%A4%96-wegostem">ü§ñ WeGoSTEM</h2>

<p>One of the other organisations taking part in the EU Code Weeks since a few years, has its roots in the hometown of Clarabridge Engage: WeGoSTEM.<br />
<em>(STEM is short for Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics, an acronym often used in education to refer to these fields, as part of a curriculum that is interdisciplinary &amp; using an applied approach.)</em></p>

<p>WeGoSTEM's mission is to organise a fun workshop in as many schools as possible (mainly in Brussels &amp; Flanders) to give as many 11 to 12 year olds as possible a first introduction to programming. Here's the robot we're building:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-10-04-teaching-kids-to-build-and-program-a-drawing-robot/drawing.png" alt="The Drawing Bot In Action" /></p>

<p>WeGoSTEM is a project of the NGO's <a href="https://dwengo.org/">Dwengo</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.shegoesict.be/">SheGoesICT</a>. Dwengo is organising teaching activities for people who want to experiment with micro-controllers, all around the world, and more specifically in socially-disadvantaged countries. SheGoesICT has as clear goal to advocate gender diversity in IT companies in Belgium.</p>

<p>The NGO's behind WeGoSTEM have diversity and inclusion in their DNA, so it's no wonder that also in the workshops they give, they focus first and foremost on reaching as many girls as boys, and focus on giving workshops in schools with many children from disadvantaged groups and rural schools. 
<em>(In 2018, 29% of the children who participated in WeGoSTEM had a special socio-economic status (SES), while the average is only 20%.)</em></p>

<p>I've joined a few workshops that teached programming concepts to kids on Wednesday afternoons or during weekends, but there's no denying these are too often an affair for boys, and for kids from economically advantaged parents. For me personally, WeGoSTEM‚Äôs focus on inclusion, is a very big motivation to volunteer for this project.</p>

<p>By the end of the workshop the main goal is to have given every single kid a fun experience. (Not about building the most complex robot, or have the most advanced programming sequence ...) The only goal is to play around with a micro-controller and use the basics of a visual programming language.</p>

<h2 id="%E2%9C%8B-how-it-is-to-volunteer">‚úã How it is to volunteer</h2>

<p>So if you sign-up to volunteer, what actually happens? First, you indicate one or more dates you're available to give the workshop in a school, and area of preference. (This year, Jared and me are heading to a school in Bruges.)<br />
There's also several training sessions around Belgium where the core team of WeGoSTEM explain the project, structure of a typical workshop, you get the time to build &amp; play with the robot yourself, and meet the other volunteers.</p>

<p>When you visit the schools, you're a team of 3 coaches (of which almost always 1 has given the workshop previously).</p>

<ul>
<li>üó£ The workshop starts with a little chat with the class to see what they know and like and find exciting about robots. <em>(Ideal place to test our dad-jokes about mowing robots ‚ò∫Ô∏è.)</em></li>
<li>üé® In a next exercise it's about trying to show kids what it is to program: one volunteer kid instructs the rest of the class to make a certain drawing. At this point it often shows the importance of clear instructions.</li>
<li>üî© And then of course: building the robot (with Knex-like blocks) and a Dwenguino-board (a pre-assembled Arduino with several sensors).</li>
<li>üíª Once the whole robot is build you help the kids to program the robot with Blockly. Blockly is Google technology that you can use &amp; embed in other projects. (You can play with an online simulator of the Dwenguino/Blockly software over here: <a href="https://dwengo.org/dwenguinoblockly/">dwengo.org/dwenguinoblockly</a>.)</li>
<li>üòÑ By the end of the workshop the goal is to send every kid home with a smile and a drawing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and in the afternoon, you do it all over again, for another class.</p>

<p>The whole experience - standing in front of a class room and having kids so eager to experiment with programming - is absolutely wonderful. And also quite exhausting (no need to convince me of the importance of good teachers, after only a single day in their shoes üòÖ.)</p>

<p>Maybe you helped inspire a kid to choose an education path focusing on STEM? Maybe you gave the teacher of that class the empowerment &amp; tools to incorporate programming in some of their lessons? Maybe you helped show policy makers the importance of digital literacy and drive change?</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-10-04-teaching-kids-to-build-and-program-a-drawing-robot/class.png" alt="A class with all their drawings ..." /></p>

<p>WeGoSTEM is 100% supported by volunteers in all participating countries. Workshops for the code week start next week, but there's definitely some free spots for coaches still. If you want to participate, check out the dedicated websites: <a href="https://wegostem.be/">WeGoSTEM Belgium</a> and <a href="https://wegostem.gr/">WeGoSTEM Greece</a>.<br />
After the Code Week, all volunteers can also always use the workshop materials needed to give an extra sessions in a school where you have a friend, kid or nephew or niece, so if you want to help us host a workshop, do let us know ...</p>

<p>Although the costs to run this project are very low (probably among the lowest euro-per-kid for STEM projects in Belgium), they can always use some extra help. WeGoSTEM is working with several partners that donate money, laptops, or help source volunteers amongst their employees.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Sometimes it's assumed that the frontend is a relatively harmless place to be programming. We've been proven wrong once again.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%94%A5%F0%9F%90%B6%E2%98%95%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%94%A5-this-is-fine">üî•üê∂‚òïÔ∏èüî• This is fine</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2019-10-02-a-tale-of-a-small-javascript-bug/this-is-fine.png" alt="This is fine" /></p>

<p>For a few months now, we have been seeing relatively high loads on our web servers. The loads varied from around 90% of the total CPU power available, to a bit over 100% in peak hours. We assumed that this was normal and that our product was just being used more (which it was), and that this was a natural burden on the load on our servers. The approach we were going to take was to continue scaling horizontally.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago however, we noticed huge daily load spikes (up to 1000% of our capacity) during peak hours. We got alert SMS'es of Redis that couldn't handle the amount of requests, and saw Kibana logs of very slow user requests to certain routes, effectively rendering our application unusable at times. It was "all hands on deck" immediately, and we started digging. Before we could find out what was happening it stopped again, and the load dropped to what we assumed was "normal load". We found, also using Kibana, that there was a huge amount of calls to our <code>/find</code> endpoint, and so we decided to implement a <a href="/blog/2017/05/02/sliding-window-rate-limiter-redis/">rate limiter</a> on those, to prevent our app from going down, and buy us some time to look for the actual issue. However, we couldn't see why that endpoint was hit so hard.</p>

<p>A few days later, when we were hit with a huge amount of calls again (this time, they were ratelimited and not producing those huge loads on our servers, but we could see them in the logs and in Kibana), we noticed that most of them were coming from only a limited number of customers. We tried to work in our app as they would do, but couldn't reproduce it. After some time however, we noticed in the network tab of the browser we were working in, that the same call to the <code>/find</code> endpoint was done multiple times simultaneously! Bingo!</p>

<p>Or not Bingo? The code seemed to be fine: When we mount our inbox's react component, we use <code>Sonora.on(eventname, callback)</code> to bind a callback to a given websocket eventname (Sonora is an abstraction around <a href="https://socket.io/">socket.io</a>). When we unmount the react component again, we call <code>Sonora.off(eventname, callback)</code> to stop listening for those events. When such an event comes in, we would potentially need more info from the backend and a call to the <code>/find</code> endpoint is issued. It definitely looked like we didn't unregister the callbacks when unmounting that component, given how we saw multiple calls being made simultaneously in the console's network tab, whenever a websocket message came in.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-10-02-a-tale-of-a-small-javascript-bug/performance-tab.png" alt="Browser's performance tab showing lots of calls to the find endpoint" /></p>

<p>While everything was looking okay in the consuming code of the Sonora <code>.on()</code> and <code>.off()</code> methods, we concluded that something must've been wrong in the wrapper around socket.io itself. When looking inside the <code>.on()</code> method, we found out that there was a debugging statement added like this:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">const Sonora = {
    // ...

    on: (event, callback) =&gt; {
        socket.on(
            event,
            () =&gt; {
                console.log('some debugging here');

                callback.apply(this, arguments);
            }
        );
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we wrapped the actual callback inside an anonymous function, and passed that on to Socket.io's <code>.on()</code> handler. Now, when calling <code>.off()</code>, we sent along the original callback which didn't match the wrapped one, and nothing was removed. Since it's possible to have multiple callbacks for each incoming event, this resulted in the same callback being added time after time and not being removed. So we had basically made all our clients do <em>loads</em> of unnecessary calls to <code>/find</code> by adding a debugging statement! And believe it or not, this debugging statement was there for a while! (Thanks git blame!)</p>

<p>The fix was easy enough: don't add that anonymous function.</p>

<p>The load on our servers dropped immediately when we put that small change into production, and not only during peak hours. It seemed that we had been on a tipping point. A few more users online at any given time, a few more open tabs with our application running in them. The servers constantly running at semi-high loads. And then we went over it. üî•</p>

<p>Along the way we did some other optimisations:</p>

<ul>
<li>we implemented a rate limiter on the <code>/find</code> endpoint</li>
<li>we disallowed to register exactly the same callback twice for the same event using <code>Sonora.on()</code></li>
<li>we fixed a second bug in <code>Sonora.off()</code> where we didn't remove the correct callbacks sometimes</li>
</ul>

<p>This was the tale of the small JavaScript bug bringing down the huge web application, a modern David and Goliath if you will. Frontend debugging <em>tricks</em> can take down your application! Every change is important, certainly changes that happen in code that's used very frequently. Some changes that look inconspicuous can over time become real bottlenecks. Tools like Kibana and the browser profiler &amp; network tabs really helped us a great deal finding the issue, so don't forget what you have at your disposal.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoyed reading about our failures! Happy debugging! üëã</p>

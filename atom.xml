<p>This year I was finally able to make it to <a href="http://nordicjs.com/">Nordic.js</a> whoot whoot.
This conference deserves to be on your radar! Read on for some impressions from a fellow dev.</p>

<h2 id="talks-%F0%9F%91%A9%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%8F%AB%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%8F%AB">Talks 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫</h2>

<p><em>At the time of writing no videos are online but they will be soonish. Check the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/nordicjs">Nordic.js youtube channel</a> for updates.</em></p>

<p>This was the first single track conference I went to and I actually prefer this format compared to multi-track conferences where you always tend to shift to things familiar. "Just serve me the menu, I trust the chefs" is much more enjoyable, and oh boy these chefs deserve some Michelin stars because the menu was delicious.</p>

<p>Talks were about Javascript, frontend development in general and the Javascript community. Below a small list of my favourites.</p>

<h3 id="sociolinguistics-and-the-javascript-community%3A-a-love-story"><a href="http://nordicjs.com/speakers#harriet-lawrence">Sociolinguistics and the Javascript community: a love story</a></h3>

<p>Let's start with "community". 
The most surprising talk of the conference was about sociolinguistics.
Not something that I would choose on a multi-track conference but super glad I saw this one. Small things can make a huge difference, and I love that.</p>

<p>Next up was a talk about React, which we use day to day at CXSocial, so any talk about it is always insightful. You often think big companies use complex techniques but actually everything can be pretty straightforward. Great tips from Mars and if you are starting out with React you should definitely check them out.</p>

<h2 id="conference-%F0%9F%8E%9F">Conference 🎟</h2>

<p>Here are some things that things that made the conference stand out:</p>

<h3 id="make-new-friends-%F0%9F%91%AD%F0%9F%91%AB">Make new friends 👭👫</h3>

<p>Nordic.js does everything in it's power to make everyone feel welcome and loved. The diverse group of people that show up is a testimony to that. A community I feel proud to be a part of.</p>

<p>The conference organizes "Dinner with new friends", a fun way to meet new people. They book a table at a restaurant in Stockholm for you and 5 other people from the conference. If you are a shy person like me you instantly have 5 new conference buddies.</p>

<h3 id="festen-%F0%9F%8E%89">Festen 🎉</h3>

<p>During the conference after party you can participate in a "Code In The Dark" competition. Create a HTML frontend site without testing your code. Does it scare you? Well me too but it's fun to watch brave souls attempt it, I suddenly understand sports now. Why wait until the conference you can actually organize it yourself just check <a href="http://codeinthedark.com/">codeinthedark.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Code in the Dark has started!

            <link href="/blog/2017/09/01/star-vars"/>
            <updated>2017-09-01T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2017/09/01/star-vars</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, we'll look at a type of variables that I call Star Vars, they're stars and shouldn't be touched. In any case. Whatsoever. Just don't start editing these in your code, or you'll eventually break stuff, with 100% guarantee.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-i%3A-the-timestamp-menace">Star Vars I: The Timestamp Menace</h2>

<p>Timestamps are nice: asking the Unix Epoch timestamp results in a number that's the same, independent of in which timezone you are. The secret to this, is that a moment in history was labeled as Unix Epoch, and the timestamp is just the number of seconds that has passed from that moment up until now.</p>

<p>And that's where things start to get nasty: with the understanding of what the number means (the number of seconds passed since January 1st 1970), people start editing the number to get dates in the past or future. What they're almost never take in consideration is the fact that time isn't linear, dates aren't the same around the globe, there are leap seconds, leap years, etc. There are too many exceptions from the rule, to just start adding <code>60 * 60 * 24</code> seconds to a timestamp's value, to get the next day. Don't do it. Your language most probably has a <code>DateTime</code> package to do just that, with less mistakes.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-ii%3A-attack-of-the-%60%24_post%60">Star Vars II: Attack Of The <code>$_POST</code></h2>

<p>When a HTTP request is made to your app, there are most likely <code>POST</code> or <code>GET</code> parameters being passed along. In PHP, and likely other languages, these are made available trough (global) variables, no different than other variables. Thus, they can be changed, or used in computations or output. Be very careful with that!</p>

<p>Changing a global variable means that it will be changed everywhere, so you risk breaking functionality in other places when you change e.g. the <code>$_POST</code> variable. Optimally, you could reduce the risk by using the immutable datastructures that your PSR-7 framework makes available to you.</p>

<p>Also, using user input in calculations and/or output might result in errors or major hacks of your software. Be very cautious! People might be able to steal your app's data, run arbitrary code on your server, or impersonate users.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-iii%3A-events-of-the-sith">Star Vars III: Events Of The Sith</h2>

<p>Since forever now, people use event dispatching and event sourcing as a way to let systems know about state changes, or even build their state from scratch based on events only. These <em>events</em> are nothing more than a "record" of something that has happened (in the past complete sense). Something that has happened will never change anymore, so the variables holding events should never be changed. Events are <em>immutable</em>. If you do change them, you change history, which I assume you aren't enabled to do.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-iv%3A-a-new-%60%24row%60">Star Vars IV: A New <code>$row</code></h2>

<p>Here's the classic "naming things" exercise. We all know it's hard, but it's also very important. Take your time, give variables an appropriate name. I'm not touching your <code>$row</code> because I don't know what it is.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-v%3A-the-query-strikes-back">Star Vars V: The Query Strikes Back</h2>

<p>Whether you're using an ORM or not, you might write the occasional database query from time to time. I find myself still writing my own queries for the sake of simplicity, inside the database specific implementation of e.g. a repository. Sometimes, for instance when you need "filter" functionality over a huge number of entities based on their various properties, it's tempting to write a query in a very generic way so that reusable parts of the query get concatenated into one final query. I find this a very dangerous practice, all the while not providing much benefit over writing the same query a few times with minor changes. Since the repository implementation we're doing this in is the only place in our codebase that knows about the database, we shouldn't care too much about duplication here.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-vi%3A-return-of-the-id">Star Vars VI: Return Of The ID</h2>

<p>Making assumptions about the form of variables can be quite dangerous. Let's say that you expect a string to be in place, but what you get is an empty string. Is that valid? Now, think of identifiers of different objects. Sometimes, people use incremental numeric values (more often than not generated by the database) as identifiers for their objects, e.g. the <code>Person</code> with id <code>1337</code> is a cool guy. Already I can think of multiple cases of unexpected values for numerical ids, like <code>0</code>, <code>-1</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>''</code>, <code>foo</code>... If we then make the assumption that we'll save them as an integer in the database, we'll shoot ourselves in the foot by saving an object with id <code>'arrow'</code> or <code>'knee'</code>. Or what if the id is a numerical value that is too big to fit inside an integer?</p>

<p>How about string representations, do you ask? For instance, post ids on the Facebook API have ids in the form of <code>{page id}_{post id}</code>. Now that you know this, given a post with an id, could you tell me the page id? Yes, but... what if Facebook decides to change their <em>naming scheme</em> for new posts (which they actually do from time to time)? From now on posts are called <code>pid_{random number}</code>. Now if we had logic in our software that depended on the implicit knowledge of the id was being made of two parts, it will break for those new posts.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is: ids are black boxes, they could contain anything, and we shouldn't make assumptions about them, break them up into meaningful parts, or save them as anything else than strings inside the database.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-vii%3A-the-%60git-push---force%60-awakens">Star Vars VII: The <code>git push --force</code> Awakens</h2>

<p>Even though <code>git</code> isn't a variable in the context of this blog post, I wanted to put this one in: <code>git push --force</code> is evil. The only reason why you would want to do this, is to change <em>public history</em>, which is something that can't be done. For more about that, scroll up to the Star Vars III section, or read <a href="/blog/2017/01/24/some-tips-for-a-better-git-history/">this blog post about git</a>.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-viii%3A-the-last-url">Star Vars VIII: The Last URL</h2>

<p>The last, but not least, "star var" is the URL. Now, we all know and understand the most basic building blocks of URLs, like the scheme, tld, and query. But actually, the standard for URLs is quite complicated, and there could be many moving parts. People don't always include the scheme (e.g. the <code>https://</code> part), or the TLD is longer than 3 characters. Therefor, parsing an URL, or changing anything meaningful of it could be very error-prone. Have a look at <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/07/improved_regex_for_matching_urls">this regular expression to parse an URL</a>. As you can see, it's not as simple as you think. In fact, most languages have <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.php">built-in functionality</a> for this, as well as <a href="http://uri.thephpleague.com/">great packages</a>. As a side-note, the same goes for e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and many other things.</p>

<p>That's it for now! Keep in mind that a lot of these problems can be solved by either using established packages, built-in language features, or <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value Objects</a> (or a mixture of several of those). May the force be with you!</p>

            <link href="/blog/2017/08/21/simple-rules-for-simpler-code"/>
            <updated>2017-08-21T11:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2017/08/21/simple-rules-for-simpler-code</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We as developers care about simple code. Simple code makes it easier to read and debug code which will allow you to build new features and fix bugs faster.</p>

<p>In this blogpost I would like to explain a few simple rules to get simpler code. The code examples will be written in PHP and are therefore more suited to procedural programming languages.</p>

<h2 id="1.-avoid-else">1. Avoid else</h2>

<p>This is probably my favourite rule. Avoiding else can drastically improve the readability of your code. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="php">if ($isAllowedToReadAutomationRecipes) {
  $automationRecipes = $this-&gt;repository-&gt;getByAccountId($accountId);
} else {
  $automationRecipes = [];
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can almost always simplify this to:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$automationRecipes = [];
if ($isAllowedToReadAutomationRecipes) {
  $automationRecipes = $this-&gt;repository-&gt;getByAccountId($accountId);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Look ma, no else!</p>

<h2 id="2.-use-early-returns">2. Use early returns</h2>

<p>Early returns are a nice way to simplify code. Using early returns goes hand in hand with avoiding else. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="php">class PostController
{
    public function delete()
    {
        $post = $this-&gt;repository-&gt;getById($postId);
        if ($post) {
            if ($isConfirmed) {
                $user-&gt;deletePost($post);
                $success = $this-&gt;repository-&gt;persist($post);
                if ($success) {
                    return $this-&gt;success('The post was successfully deleted');
                } else {
                    return $this-&gt;error('Something went wrong.');
                }
            } else {
                return $this-&gt;confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this post?');
            }
        } else {
            return $this-&gt;error('The post was not found.');
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's really hard to see the flow of the code, don't you think? Let's refactor the example to use early returns:</p>

<pre><code class="php">class PostController
{
    public function delete()
    {
        $post = $this-&gt;repository-&gt;getById($postId);
        if ($post === null) {
            return $this-&gt;error('The post was not found.');
        }
        if ($isConfirmed === false) {
            return $this-&gt;confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this post?');
        }

        $user-&gt;deletePost($post);
        $success = $this-&gt;repository-&gt;persist($post);
        if ($success === false) {
            return $this-&gt;error('Something went wrong. Try again.');
        }

        return $this-&gt;success('The post was successfully deleted');
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What do you prefer? I surely prefer the latter. Early returns keep the level of indentation low and make the happy path of the code visible.</p>

<h2 id="3.-use-meaningful-variables-names">3. Use meaningful variables names</h2>

<p>If you abbreviate the names of variables you probably don't have a good IDE (autocompletion). It might make sense to use abbreviations while writing some quick code but it will eventually shoot you in the back when you need to fix a bug. You'll lose valuable time by deciphering the code.</p>

<h2 id="4.-avoid-code-comments">4. Avoid code comments</h2>

<p>Each time you're commenting code you're failing to express yourself. This rule goes hand in hand with meaningful variable names. Code comments can get outdated and nothing is as damaging as lies and misinformation. The code is the only source of truth. If you find yourself writing a code comment think of ways to make it clear in the code by extracting variables and functions with meaningful names. Sometimes a well placed comment can be helpful. They'll likely explain the why while the code explains the what/how.</p>

<h2 id="5.-follow-a-consistent-coding-standard">5. Follow a consistent coding standard</h2>

<p>Following a consistent coding standard makes sure all code is formatted in the same way. Which makes it easier to read code because you expect it to be formatted in a specific way. For PHP this is <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/">PSR-2</a>. I don't like every rule in <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/">PSR-2</a> but it doesn't matter as long as everyone writes the same code. Please don't invent your own coding standard. It's a good practice to <a href="http://cs.sensiolabs.org/">lint and fix</a> coding style automatically.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope these simple rules will inspire you to leave the campground cleaner than you found it. Which rules do you think are important? Leave a comment (on disqus they are allowed)! If you want to know more, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a> is good read.</p>

<p>"Avoiding else" is a rule from <a href="https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/luontola/tdd-2009/ext/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf">Object Calisthenics</a>. If you want to become a better developer, read it.</p>

            <link href="/blog/2017/08/01/tips-for-better-phpunit-tests"/>
            <updated>2017-08-01T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2017/08/01/tips-for-better-phpunit-tests</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Writing good unit tests can be a pain. When you write your tests superfluously, you're testing more than the single unit, and they start failing with reasons not related to the <em>Subject Under Test (SUT)</em>. Or your tests become unreadable, and you can't figure out what they were supposed to be testing. Or they test only the one situation where everything goes according to plan, and not possible errors. Of course we want to mitigate all that! Let's see some simple tips to keep your test suite clean and working all the time.</p>

<h2 id="test-the-unhappy-path-first">Test the unhappy path first</h2>

<p>You could've sworn that your test was complete, but there seem to be exceptional cases that you missed. When writing unit tests -and doing TDD in particular- thinking about what might go wrong is very important: how should your unit fail, and when? What should happen when it fails? Should it throw exceptions? If you start with this, you won't forget to do it, and you'll write more robust code as a side-effect.</p>

<h2 id="assertions-have-a-structure">Assertions have a structure</h2>

<p>You might not know it, but most PHPUnit assertions have their parameters in the same order. They almost always take <code>$expected</code> and <code>$actual</code> as first and second parameters respectively. The third (and optional) parameter is often <code>$message</code>, which is a specific message you can write to make PHPUnit rapport back to you with when something fails. This is important, because in case of failure, PHPUnit will report you that your assertion's actual value doesn't match what you expected (so order is significant here). Let's see some examples:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$this-&gt;assertEquals($expected, $actual, $message);
$this-&gt;assertSame($expected, $actual, $message);
$this-&gt;assertTrue($condition, $message);
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the <code>assertTrue()</code> call misses an <code>$expected</code> part, as it's already made clear in the name of the assertion.</p>

<h2 id="use-the-correct-assertion">Use the correct assertion</h2>

<p>To me, the daddy of all assertions is <code>assertEquals</code>, it's the basis of a unit test. You assert that your <em>Subject Under Test</em> gives a return value that's equal to what you expect it to return. If you're in doubt about which assertion is the right one to use, always pick <code>assertEquals</code>. The added benifit you get, is that PHPUnit displays really nice diffs between the <code>$expected</code> and <code>$actual</code> values if they don't match. That's much less useful when you use <code>assertTrue</code>, and it can only tell you that <code>False</code> is not equal to <code>True</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-08-01-tips-for-better-phpunit-tests/phpunit-diff.png" alt="Diff that PHPUnit shows when expected is different than the actual value" /></p>

<h2 id="pick-names-that-make-sense">Pick names that make sense</h2>

<p>PHPUnit expects you to start the name of your test methods with <code>test</code>, so that you get names like <code>testItThrowsAnExceptionWhenNetworkIsDown()</code>. Although that name is quite descriptive (and it should be!) it doesn't read very well. We can, however, make much more readable function names using underscores. What do you think of <code>test_it_throws_an_exception_when_network_is_down()</code>? It might not fit your coding standard (i'm looking at you, PSR-2), but isn't readability worth the occasional exception to some rules that are meant for readability? Also note, that be reading the name of the test method like this, it's totally clear to me what that test does, and I don't have to go in and read the code if I don't need to change it.</p>

<h2 id="data-providers-for-clear-failure-messages">Data Providers for clear failure messages</h2>

<p>If you need to test the same method with a huge number of inputs and make the same assertion over and over again, you might be tempted to write your assertion inside a <code>foreach</code> loop or something similar.</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function test_prices_cast_to_strings()
{
    $validPrices = array(
        '$100' =&gt; new Price(10000),
        '$10' =&gt; new Price(1000),
        '$1' =&gt; new Price(100),
        '$0.10' =&gt; new Price(10),
        '$0.01' =&gt; new Price(1),
    );

    foreach ($validPrices as $expectedString =&gt; $price) {
        $this-&gt;assertEquals($expectedString, (string) $price);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this, is that all your assertions happen on the same line, and PHPUnit will rapport a failure in one of those assertions as a failure on that line. Then you'll have to play detective and start looking through your test data to see where things break. This is where PHPUnit Data Providers come in handy, check it out:</p>

<pre><code class="php">/**
 * @dataProvider validPrices
 */
public function test_prices_cast_to_strings($expectedString, $price)
{
    $this-&gt;assertEquals($expectedString, (string) $price);
}

public function validPrices()
{
    return array(
        array('$100', new Price(10000)),
        array('$10', new Price(1000)),
        array('$1', new Price(100)),
        array('$0.10', new Price(10)),
        array('$0.01', new Price(1)),
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now PHPUnit will tell you which input data made the test fail. Don't you think this also cleans up the test so much more? No more <code>foreach</code> that didn't add any meaning to the test! What's also good to know, is that the <code>@dataProvider</code> annotation also works in conjunction with the <code>@expectedException</code> annotation, so you can also easily test if your method throws exceptions for invalid input.</p>

<pre><code class="php">/**
 * @dataProvider invalidPrices
 * @expectedException InvalidArgumentException
 */
public function test_prices_throw_when_built_from_non_integer_value($nonInteger)
{
    $price = new Price($nonInteger);
}

public function invalidPrices()
{
    return array(
        array('foo'),
        array(null),
        array(true),
        array(false),
        array(0.01),
        array('1'),
    );
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="programming-against-interfaces">Programming against interfaces</h2>

<p>When you're writing tests for a SOLID codebase, be it in a test-first fashion, or writing tests after the facts, you'll be glad you used interfaces for your <em>Subject Under Test</em>'s dependencies. Not only do they give you the obvious benefits of "being able to swap out dependencies with a totally different implementation" or "not caring about specifics, if you just adhere to the contract", but also this means that you can test your class without its dependencies! Look at this example, where <code>Bank</code> has two dependencies:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

final class Bank
{
    private $clock;
    private $log;

    public function __construct(Clock $clock, TransactionLog $log)
    {
        $this-&gt;clock = $clock;
        $this-&gt;log = $log;
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, <code>Bank</code> cannot operate without its dependencies, so in our test we'll have to instantiate it correctly, but we'll use test doubles, so that we can test <code>Bank</code> with e.g. a <code>Clock</code> that we control:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$clock = $this-&gt;getMock('Clock');
$clock
    -&gt;method('getTime')
    -&gt;willReturn(new DateTime('2017-07-15 10:00:00'));

$log = $this-&gt;getMock('TransactionLog');

$bank = new Bank($clock, $log);
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we know that <code>Clock</code> will always return a given time, we can make assertions that e.g. a <code>Bank</code> transaction was done at the time the clock returned, instead of taking a guess and using stuff like <code>time()</code> or <code>new DateTime('now')</code>. On the <code>TransactionLog</code>, we could assert that a certain method got called (because we expect a transaction to be made), and thus validate if the <code>Bank</code> communicates correctly with it:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$now = new DateTime('2017-07-15 10:00:00');
$clock = $this-&gt;getMock('Clock');
$clock
    -&gt;method('getTime')
    -&gt;willReturn($now);

$transaction = new Transaction('Toon', 'Hans', 100, $now);
$log = $this-&gt;getMock('TransactionLog');
$log
    -&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
    -&gt;method('log')
    -&gt;with($this-&gt;equalTo($transaction));

$bank = new Bank($clock, $log);
$bank-&gt;payment('Toon', 'Hans', 100);
</code></pre>

<p>On the last line we do the call that your code would actually do to make a bank transaction (this is example code, beware). This makes the <code>Bank</code> log a <code>Transaction</code> in the <code>TransactionLog</code>. Since we control the clock, we can assert on the correct time in the <code>Transaction</code>. Also note that this is a complete test. The rather invisible assertion is the <code>$this-&gt;equalTo()</code> call. We're asserting that <code>Bank</code> communicates correctly to the <code>TransactionLog</code>.</p>

<h2 id="interface-discovery">Interface Discovery</h2>

<p>When we're doing TDD, the PHPUnit test doubles can help us "discovering" what an interface must be, in order to have a dependency that properly supports our <em>Subject Under Test</em>. This works because PHPUnit's mocks will mock any non-existing interfaces. Let's say we want the bank to trigger a WebHook whenever a transaction was made, containing the transaction details.</p>

<pre><code class="php">$clock = $this-&gt;getMock('Clock');
$log = $this-&gt;getMock('TransactionLog');

// The WebHooks interface doesn't exist yet
$webhooks = $this-&gt;getMock('WebHooks');
$webhooks
    -&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
    -&gt;method('trigger')
    -&gt;with($this-&gt;equalTo('{"transaction": {"from": "Toon", "to": "Hans", "amount": 100}}'));

$bank = new Bank($clock, $log, $webhooks);
$bank-&gt;payment('Toon', 'Hans', 100);
</code></pre>

<p>Without having an interface, we can already define what we want to see happening. Our test then fails, because the <code>trigger()</code> method didn't get called, so we can start implementing. When we're done, we'll see that our <code>Bank</code> class tests green, and we have discovered a very simple interface for the <code>WebHooks</code> that we can now create (see a whole blog post about this in the Further Reading section).</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

interface WebHooks
{
    public function trigger($jsonContents);
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2>

<p>These were only a few of the things that you can do to make your testsuite better than it is right now! There are lots of ways to improve even further. My strategy is to not only refactor the code (when tests are green of course), but also the tests, to make them as comprehensive and robust as possible. Think about how you can make them easy to understand for the next person looking to improve or change them. Here's some more reading material that can help you out:</p>

            <link href="/blog/2017/07/10/perceived-performance"/>
            <updated>2017-07-10T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2017/07/10/perceived-performance</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="what-is-perceived-performance%3F">What is perceived performance?</h2>

<p>Perceived performance refers to how fast a user thinks your site is, rather than the actual site speed. It's a metric measured by humans rather than a site speed test tool. How fast does the website feel? For example, Facebook appears faster by loading a placeholder for posts in the News Feed. It's useful to know that a site is only loading rather than functioning slowly.</p>

<h2 id="how-cx-social-handles-perceived-performance">How CX Social Handles Perceived Performance</h2>

<p>CX Social is a large application that has a complex interface. The "inbox" part of our system has multiple small features, that all appear to be on a single page. The perceived performance of the inbox is more important than the actual speed, especially because it provides a seamless user experience. The following are a few things we do to portray a speedier performance!</p>

<h2 id="when-a-mention-is-resolved">When a mention is resolved</h2>

<p>In CX Social we process small pieces of information we call "mentions". A mention is any blog post, news article, tweet, etc. that matches any of your specified criteria. All mentions are refined into the CX Social inbox, where support agents can mark them as <em>resolved</em> when they are replied to/labelled as no action needed, etc. When a mention is <em>resolved</em> the support agent is automatically shown the next <em>mention</em> to attend to.
When a mention is resolved we manipulate the DOM and remove the element <em>before</em> the request is completed successfully. This gives you the impression that your action is completed instantly. In the rare case that the request fails, we replace the DOM element and display a relevant error message, so that the user knows what's going on and can resolve the mention again.</p>

<p><center>
<img src="/images/2017-07-10-perceived-performance/mentionresolve.gif" alt="Resolving a mention in CX Social Inbox" /><br />
<small>Resolving a mention in CX Social Inbox</small>
</center></p>

<h2 id="loading-indicators">Loading Indicators</h2>

<p>Loading icons can become a bit annoying on snappy pages because you see a flickering behaviour, and it makes the user feel as though they have to unnecessarily <em>wait</em>. Snappy pages don't require a loading icon, but we'd like a back up plan in case the page takes longer than expected to load. In this case, we use a timeout function for the loading functionality, and only show the loading interface when the request takes over X milliseconds to complete.</p>

<p><center>
<img src="/images/2017-07-10-perceived-performance/delayloading.gif" alt="Delay loading" /><br />
<small>Don't show a loading indicator for quick requests</small>
</center></p>

<p>In this instance, there's a 3000 millisecond delay on the loading behaviour for this page.</p>

<p><center>
<img src="/images/2017-07-10-perceived-performance/delayloadingspinner.gif" alt="Delay loading" /><br />
<small>Do show a loading indicator when a request is taking longer than usual</small>
</center></p>

<h2 id="placeholder-mentions-in-inbox">Placeholder mentions in inbox</h2>

<p>Similar to how Facebook shows a preview of your feed by showing mini placeholders for each post, we show a placeholder when loading a list of mentions in CX Social. 
We immediately show the selected mention, but for other mentions in the thread we automatically show a mention placeholder while they're loading. Then when the user scrolls farther in the thread, we pop in the next mentions. This gives structure to the page, while data is loading and thus makes it easier for the eye/mind to prepare for that data to be there.</p>

<p><center>
<img src="/images/2017-07-10-perceived-performance/inboxloading.gif" alt="Loading of inbox" /><br />
<small>Placeholder sections for mentions in the CX Social inbox</small>
</center></p>

<h2 id="additional-information-in-dropdowns%2Fpopups">Additional information in dropdowns/popups</h2>

<p>When you display a popup or dropdown there's no need to fetch every piece of information immediately. On each Twitter mention we have a "following" dropdown which shows the list of profiles that is following the author of the mention. It also shows whether you are following <em>that</em> profile and if <em>that</em> profile is following <em>you</em>. However we only load the latter information when the dropdown is opened. Sometimes we hit Twitter rate limits, and still try to display relevant following info based on our cache. If we don't have any info, we will still show the dropdown with ability to follow someone (but without displaying who they're already following) since those two endpoints have separate rate limits.</p>

<p><center>
<img src="/images/2017-07-10-perceived-performance/twitterfollowers.gif" alt="Loading of Twitter Followers" /><br />
<small>Dropdown that shows if you are following the author of a mention and vice versa</small>
</center></p>

<h2 id="loading-new-content-without-a-page-reload">Loading new content without a page reload</h2>

<p>We have a large sidebar in CX Social for navigation, as well as a top menu bar. When switching between pages, we just request the content for the main part of the page, and insert the new main content. This saves us doing a full page load.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Have you implemented any features to improve perceived performance? We'd love to hear about it!</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-do%3F">What do we do?</h2>

<p>The Clarabridge CX Social team builds a customer care tool for social media. Our clients use our software to be able to respond to the incoming questions and complaints on their Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, Instagram profiles, a.o. These clients often have a high volume of messages, on several social profiles. We try to make those people’s lives easier by offering automation tools, smart routing of messages and reply suggestions, among others.<br />
<a href="https://developers.engagor.com/team">Read more about what we do</a>.</p>

<p>As of September 2017, we have room for one or more enthusiastic interns to join us for (at least) a couple of weeks <em>(preferably 4 days a week, any time between September 2017 to June 2018)</em>, to work as part of the CX Social development team. As an intern you are an integral part of the R&amp;D team working on different parts of the application using technologies like PHP, React, MySQL, Redis, memcached, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, a.o. The other team members include a designer, front-end developer, data scientist, and several system engineers &amp; full-stack web developers.<br />
We are looking for a student with interest and knowledge of both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>

            <link href="/blog/2017/06/15/vim-ide-refactoring"/>
            <updated>2017-06-15T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2017/06/15/vim-ide-refactoring</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>This blogpost is part of the "Vim As A PHP IDE" series, which starts <a href="/blog/2017/01/01/vim-ide-setting-up">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I kept the best for last. The feature I get the most questions about is the refactoring capabilities of IDEs. While Vim has some great features that most IDEs don't have, it certainly is true that this is one of the features that Vim is not really that good at. Or is it? In any case, it's good enough at it for me. Let's see what we got.</p>

<h2 id="how-would-you-do-it-from-the-cli%3F">How would you do it from the cli?</h2>

<p>Basically, if some functionality is not in Vim by default, there are two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a command line tool that already does the job - this is how Vim fits into the UNIX philosophy.</li>
<li>Use Vimscript to program the functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily, there's this neat tool called <a href="https://github.com/QafooLabs/php-refactoring-browser/">PHP Refactoring Browser</a>, that already knows how to do some PHP refactorings from the command line.</p>

<ul>
<li>extract method;</li>
<li>rename local variable;</li>
<li>local variable to instance variable;</li>
<li>optimise use statements;</li>
</ul>

<p>The tool is also open source, so we can add missing refactorings in the future. The tool is standing on the shoulders of giants like <a href="https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser">PHP Parser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Andrewsville/PHP-Token-Reflection">PHP Token Reflection</a>. But doing this from the command line isn't that great...</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/refactoring-browser.png" alt="Running the Refactoring Browser from the command line" /></p>

<h2 id="vim-integration">Vim integration</h2>

<p>Of course, some people already thought this was useful for Vim people, and created <a href="https://github.com/vim-php/vim-php-refactoring">a plugin</a> to wrap the command line tool. I'm assuming you installed the command line tool in <code>/usr/local/bin/refactor.phar</code>. Install the plugin using your favorite Vim package manager, and put this line in your <code>.vimrc</code> to let the plugin know where to look for the executable:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">" PHP refactoring browser
let g:php_refactor_command='/usr/local/bin/refactor.phar'
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/refactoring-in-vim.png" alt="Running the Refactoring Browser from within Vim" /></p>

<p>You can now do these basic refactorings using their hotkey <code>&lt;Leader&gt;r</code> and selecting your desired refactoring from the list. That's nice, but there are some refactorings missing that we'd like, e.g. "Extract Interface".</p>

<h2 id="creating-refactorings-with-vimscript">Creating refactorings with Vimscript</h2>

<p>While the best solution would definitely be to contribute to the PHP Refactoring Browser, we want to have this functionality right now. Let's create the "Extract Interface" refactoring in Vimscript. I'd like to select some class methods using linewise <code>VISUAL</code> mode, issue a command on it, fill in the name of the Interface that I'd like the methods be extracted to, and have the current class implement that method. Let's see what we got:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">command! -range PhpExtractInterfaceFromRange &lt;line1&gt;,&lt;line2&gt;call PhpInterfaceFromRange()

function! PhpInterfaceFromRange() range
  let interface = input('Enter extracted interface name: ')
  call PhpExtractInterface(a:firstline, a:lastline, interface)
endfunction

function! PhpExtractInterface(start, end, interface)
  normal! qkq
  execute ''.a:start.','.a:end.'g/public.*function.*(\_.\{-})/normal ^f(V%"Ky'
  let @k = substitute(@k, ' \?{', '', 'g')
  let @k = substitute(@k, ')', ');', 'g')
  ?class
  execute "normal! A implements ".a:interface
  execute "normal! Ointerface ".a:interface
  execute "normal! o{\&lt;CR&gt;}\&lt;CR&gt;"
  normal! k"kP
  normal! dd
endfunction
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>We create a command, called <code>PhpExtractInterfaceFromRange</code> which can be called with a Vim range (like <code>10,50</code>, or from a <code>VISUAL</code> select). If the command is issued, it calls a Vimscript function with the name <code>PhpInterfaceFromRange()</code></li>
<li>The <code>PhpInterfaceFromRange()</code> function asks the user how they want to call their new interface, and passes the range and the name of that interface to <code>PhpExtractInterface()</code></li>
<li>Here's where the real magic happens. We clear register <code>k</code>, and search for all public method definitions in the specified range. We then append every definition to the <code>k</code> register. We then remove curly braces <code>{}</code> and put the missing <code>;</code> after every method definition. We search for the start of the current class, and make it implement the interface. We then create the interface with the contents of the register <code>k</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/extract-interface-1.png" alt="Extracting an interface from a class with one method selected in Visual Mode" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/2017-06-15-vim-ide-refactoring/extract-interface-2.png" alt="Interface was extracted successfully" /></p>

<p><strong>Wow</strong></p>

<p>Since this is now a command, it could easily be assigned a <code>&lt;Leader&gt;</code> hotkey for visual mode selects, for instance. And you could easily do the same thing for e.g. "Extract Class".</p>

<p>Now, I created this in half an hour, and it's perfectly usable in most use cases, but it's not perfect. As this is the only refactoring I really missed from the Refactoring Browser, I'll just use this until a real refactoring gets integrated in the real plugin. There are plugins with some more Vimscript implementations of refactorings, like <a href="https://github.com/adoy/vim-php-refactoring-toolbox">this one</a>. Keep in mind that they will be susceptible to mistakes, as they don't <em>really</em> understand your PHP code like the Refactoring Browser does.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>So, that's it for this episode, and for now this will also be the end of this blog series for now. I hope you liked it! Happy Vimming!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This February, Gheerwijn joined the CX Social development team as an intern. Now, three months later, with the bulk of his internship over, we’ve asked him what that was like and what he built.</p>

<h3 id="building-a-social-profile-manager">Building a Social Profile Manager</h3>

<p>The idea for the subject of the internship started a few years ago when several of our customers, including the <a href="https://twitter.com/nmbs">Belgian Railways NMBS</a>, started showing off their Twitter reply times in their cover photo. NMBS took the reply time for their Twitter profile from the CX Social API and wrote the necessary code to showcase that on their page.</p>

</center></p>

<p>We thought it would be great to build this into CX Social itself and improve on the idea with the extra features our tool offers, like having different cover images depending on your business hours, or showing different avatars depending on if a certain crisis plan is active. 
Gheerwijn, a student of <a href="https://www.odisee.be/nl/elektronica-ict">Electronica - ICT at Odisee Gent</a>, took on this challenge and dove right in.</p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn</strong>: <em>"The main purpose of the Profile Manager is to give CX Social customers a single place to manage all of their owned social profiles. Not only can it manage basic profile information, but it can also perform more complex tasks. The most striking feature of the Profile Manager is the ability to create themes. These themes are a combination of a profile photo and cover photo."</em></p>

<p>The idea was to offer clients the possibility to upload their own pictures and even annotate them. These annotations include plain text, but also variables like "reply time" or "unique users serviced".</p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"After a theme has been created, it can be scheduled for one or more profiles. This means that CX Social users can choose when a specific theme, like a Christmas theme, should be shown on certain profiles. We've also added the option to show different themes during/outside configured business hours schedules."</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>"This feature gives companies with a large customer base on social the ability to be transparant on how long it will approximately take to get an answer to their questions."</em></strong> - Gheerwijn</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="using-react-and-node.js">Using React and Node.js</h3>

<p>When asked about what were some of the most interesting aspects of the project, Gheerwijn cites the JavaScript library React and the backend technology Node.js as two fun technologies to work with.</p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"I had heard of React but never actually used it. A first experiment I did with it was a component to handle the scheduling of a theme. It proved to be an excellent way to quickly create interactive user interfaces, so I started to use it for everything I possibly could."</em></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"I also got to work on a Node.js microservice. Although I had already worked with Node.js on several occasions, I got to use new modules and libraries, like Fabric, which made it an interesting learning opportunity. I love how Node.js brings the joy of writing JavaScript to the backend.
The hardest part to get right was having the annoted images render correctly, both on the front-end as well as in the back-end."</em></p>

</center></p>

<p><strong>CX Social: Did you acquire any non-technical skills while working here?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn</strong>: <em>"Preparing for the weekly status meetings was a great way to learn how to separate the important things from the less important ones. It forced me to spend more time thinking about how the users would eventually use this feature. I learned that things that are obvious to the programmer aren't necessarily clear to the users."</em></p>

<h3 id="a-look-behind-the-scenes">A Look Behind the Scenes</h3>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"What drew me to this internship proposal was the fact that it involved social media. Everyone and their mother has a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram account. Not only individuals, but also companies are using social media on a daily basis. In this day and age, social media is something irreplaceable.
I started at CX Social because I wanted a look behind the scenes."</em></p>

<p><strong>CX Social:</strong> <strong>Did you have any idea what to expect that first day you started?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>I actually expected it to be quite stressful, mainly because it was such a big project to complete, but also because you suddenly start working in a company and you have to get to know everything and everyone.</em></p>

<p><strong>CX Social:</strong> <strong>So, how high were the stress levels then?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"Well, the team was very helpful. I felt like a real part of the team and not just ‘the intern’.
Anthony helped me out with getting to know the do's and don'ts in the codebase. Hans introduced me to several best practices and ways to make my code better. Down the road, I got to work with Jared and Ursula, who both took care of the design. Jurriaan was always able to come up with a solution to problems I would've never been able to fix on my own. And Toon showed me how to integrate my features in the task-scheduling back-end of CX Social. In the end, I got to work with everyone from the development team. I learned a lot just from asking other people how they would approach a certain problem."</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>"It was also great to be able to have my feedback always taken into account when making decisions."</em></strong> - Gheerwijn</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"When I thought something didn't make sense the way it was expected to be implemented, my thoughts about what I thought should change were actually taken into account and implemented."</em></p>

<p><strong>CX Social: Any moments during your internship that stood out?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"There are two moments I won't forget. The team went on a two-day off-site bootcamp. It was the perfect way to get to know all the team members. After an entire day of working, the evenings were filled with fun activities. It was certainly not something I was expecting to do during my internship!
The second unforgettable moment was the last day of my internship. After months of working on this one feature, the time had come to deploy it to production. We spent the last days pair programming the last bits to be able to put it live for testing. It was great seeing the work I did go live to beta-testers."</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>"Let me end with sharing an important tip for any interns after me: Work hard and buy a Nerf gun. You won't survive long without one."</em></strong> - Gheerwijn</p>

            <id>/blog/2017/05/22/implementing-little-big-details-on-offsite-bootcamp</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, we went on a two-day off-site with the CX Social development team for an event we dubbed "improvement bootcamp". It's the second time we did something like this and since it was fun and we got quite a lot of stuff done, we wanted to share our story. Maybe it could work for your team as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-roadmaps">The problem with roadmaps</h2>

<p>The idea behind a bootcamp is "drop everything, let's work on something else, someplace else for a few days". For two days, we were hidden away in a beautiful house in the fields of Waasland where we focused solely on what we like to call "little big details".</p>

<p>Over the course of the 6+ years that our product has existed, we have built up a huge database of customer requests. Prioritization and implementation of those requests is a constant process; in fact, almost all of our roadmap is compromised of client-requested features. We take logging these requests very seriously. Feature requests come to us through our ideas forum (where clients can post &amp; up-vote ideas), via our Live Chat, and via our dedicated Customer Success team. All of this information (what is requested, who is requesting it, if it's technically possible/feasible, etc.) is then ranked by priority and, after being curated by the Product Team, makes up the roadmap.</p>

<p>That roadmap becomes our daily job, at least when we're not playing <a href="https://engagor.github.io/blog/2017/03/01/batman-chatman/">Batman</a>. We always have a detailed roadmap for the next release of our product (around three months), and a more general one for the upcoming 12 months. This balance works for us; we can commit certain projects to our customers, while on the longer term we can stay flexible, react quickly to changing customer demands, and implement new social functionality when it becomes available.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/2017-05-22-march-2017-bootcamp/doing-all-at-once.gif" alt="When we try to do all at once" /><br />
<small>When we try to do all at once</small>
</center></p>

<p>But, as it often goes, projects aren't perfectly defined from the start (their scope often grows) and we developers tend to underestimate projects, so getting everything finished on-time sometimes (more often than we’d like) results in neglecting some of the details. Those are the details that make a product stress-free, or - why not - even fun to use.</p>

<p>The "improvement bootcamp" is our initiative to force ourselves to periodically step back and focus on these little big details.</p>

<h2 id="little-big-details">Little Big Details</h2>

<p>But what do we mean with “little big details”? It can be anything from natural sorting of elements in tables, consistent design of similar pages throughout the application, to friendlier wording of messages in the application.</p>

<p>Often, they're simple things. Often, they're not real “new” features. Often, you might not even know you were missing them.</p>

<p>Have you noticed how, when using Google Maps to get directions to another place, the walking man icon changes into a person with a backpack and walking sticks? Or how Spotify congratulates you on your good taste in music when you click 'Lyrics' on a song that Spotify doesn't have lyrics for?</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/2017-05-22-march-2017-bootcamp/google-maps.png" alt="Little big detail in Google Maps" /><br />
<small>Little big detail in Google Maps</small></center></p>

<p>It's stuff like this that makes good products even more enjoyable to use.</p>

<p>For our tool, a few of the candidates we selected for the bootcamp include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A more consistent loading/empty view of widgets around the different dashboards that CX Social offers;</li>
<li>Requiring people to type the name of the topic they want to delete;</li>
<li>Remembering the text you typed in the reply bar, so that if it fails, users can easily try again;</li>
<li>Make the "click area" of widgets bigger when selecting widgets to add to a dashboard;</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these features will win awards, nor will they ever be on the top of most requested features lists; sometimes they're just small nuisances. But they do have an impact; it's details that make the difference between a good software product and one that's actually fun to use.</p>

<h2 id="the-action-plan">The action plan</h2>

<p><center><img src="/images/2017-05-22-march-2017-bootcamp/action-plan.png" alt="Spreadsheet with the action plan" /><br />
<small>Spreadsheet with the action plan</small></center></p>

<p>This was our action plan to get as much of this done, in a short timeframe, and have some fun while doing it:</p>

<ol>
<li>To start, we asked all members of the CX Social team, from Sales to Marketing, to tag improvements in our Github repository that they thought would fit the goal.</li>
<li>These were scored on a few aspects:

<ol>
<li>Priority: Indicator of how aligned the idea is with our product vision.</li>
<li>Impact: How many customers are requesting it or would benefit from it?</li>
<li>Workload: How long would it take us to implement this? (If it's expected to take longer than 4 hours, it's probably not a good candidate.)</li>
<li>Coolness: Sometimes the really fun ideas need a little bump, don't they?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The candidates were sorted according to the formula <code>(Impact * 1.5) + (Priority * 5) + (Workload * -2) + Coolness</code>. This would be the order in which we would tackle them.</li>
<li>The top 50 items in this priority list were discussed with everyone in the development team and assigned.</li>
<li>We started working on them on Wednesday morning with the goal of finishing work by Thursday evening.</li>
<li>During the coding, we kept track of our own and each other’s progress on a Github project board; indicating whenever a certain improvement was implemented, ready for review, reviewed, and ready for production.</li>
<li>On Thursday evening, we presented internally to the development team what everyone was able to accomplish.</li>
</ol>

<p><center><img src="/images/2017-05-22-march-2017-bootcamp/github-project-board.png" alt="Github Project Board" /><br />
<small>Github Project Board</small></center></p>

<h2 id="the-results">The results</h2>

<p>On Friday afternoon - our weekly beer-o'clock in the Gent office - we presented the results of the bootcamp to the whole CX Social team. In total, we were able to get 42 things done. The list included a bunch of internal improvements - thus making our support ninjas happy - and it included some longstanding customer requests.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/2017-05-22-march-2017-bootcamp/results-presentation-slide.png" alt="Slide from the presentation to the team" /><br />
<small>Slide from the presentation to the team</small></center></p>

<p>It did take a few more days to put everything from the bootcamp into production, because we still had to hand it over to QA, prepare any customer communication, and make sure the merges happened in a coordinated way.</p>

<p>If you would argue that details and fun stuff like this should be part of the standard product and development workflow, I totally agree. And while events like this might look like "patching", they actually contribute to installing that mindset by making everyone in the team aware of the importance of these.</p>

<p>A bootcamp like this has the pleasant side effect of actually proving what we as a team are able to accomplish in a short timeframe. That feeling of speed, and accompanying pride, is a bit harder to find when you're working on bigger, long-term projects that involve lots more nuts and bolts.
Working outside of your comfort zone, by working on features in the code base you haven't seen before, or more literally, by not sitting at your desk, increased team communication and trained new team members.</p>

<p>And of course, you get to learn new stuff about your colleagues after hours. Like how passionate Gheerwijn is about analog cameras.
And that's about all the info you’ll get, because: "what happens at the bootcamp, stays at the bootcamp". Let this vague Polaroid picture of the team be a little testament to that.</p>

            <link href="/blog/2017/05/15/vim-ide-testing"/>
            <updated>2017-05-15T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2017/05/15/vim-ide-testing</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>This blogpost is part of the "Vim As A PHP IDE" series, which starts <a href="/blog/2017/01/01/vim-ide-setting-up">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>I used to always run my unit tests from the command line, but the integration that IDEs give is great. If something goes wrong you can immedately jump to where you need to be to fix it, and your test results remain visible in the same window you're working on. I wanted the same thing in Vim, so I started the investigation.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to use the default Vim <code>:!</code> shell command mode for that (if you want to know more, check <code>:h :!</code>). I was using <a href="http://www.phpspec.net/">phpspec</a> at that time, so I created two hotkeys, one to describe a new class, and one to run the tests. In <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">" PHP run phpspec
noremap &lt;Leader&gt;d :! bin/phpspec desc 
noremap &lt;Leader&gt;o :! bin/phpspec run&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with that approach, is that Vim doesn't know what to do with them, and just shows you the command line output they provide. I wanted more integration between my tools. After some more looking around, I found out that Vim has support to run a <code>compiler</code> command, and interpret its output with some kind of regex. You can run it using <code>:make</code> and if there are errors in the build, it collects them in a list which you can use to jump to the place you need to be to fix it. Sounds just like what I needed!</p>

<p>And yes, it turns out some other people also found that out. There's a <a href="https://github.com/afternoon/vim-phpunit">PHPUnit compiler</a>, which lets you use Vim's <code>:make</code> command with PHPUnit. Great! There also seems to be a <a href="https://github.com/renanivo/phpspec.vim">phpspec compiler</a>.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that Vim picks the right compiler for the right filetype, so you can do something similar for JavaScript files in your project, and have it all work fantastically with <code>:make</code>.</p>

<p>The last step for me was to create a hotkey in <code>.vimrc</code>, so that I can constantly run my unit tests with just one keystroke:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">noremap &lt;leader&gt;m :make&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If your tests fail, <code>:make</code> fills up Vim's quickfix list with them. In <a href="/blog/2017/03/15/vim-ide-quality-control">episode 2</a>, I already showed you how to enable it to automatically open and close when it's filled or empty, respectively:</p>

<pre><code class="vim">" Automatically open &amp; close quickfix window
autocmd QuickFixCmdPost [^l]* nested cwindow
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/2017-05-15-vim-ide-testing/phpunit.png" alt="A test in PHPUnit failed" /></p>

<p>If you want to jump through the different errors without focussing on that list, you can just use <code>:cnext</code> and <code>:cprev</code>.</p>

<p>After some testing and trying out, it all seemed to work great for me. Fantastic, up to <a href="/blog/2017/06/15/vim-ide-refactoring">the next episode</a>!</p>

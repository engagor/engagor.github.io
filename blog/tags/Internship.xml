<h2 id="what-do-we-do%3F">What do we do?</h2>

<p>The Clarabridge CX Social team builds a customer care tool for social media. Our clients use our software to be able to respond to the incoming questions and complaints on their Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, Instagram profiles, a.o. These clients often have a high volume of messages, on several social profiles. We try to make those people’s lives easier by offering automation tools, smart routing of messages and reply suggestions, among others.<br />
<a href="https://developers.engagor.com/team">Read more about what we do</a>.</p>

<p>As of September 2017, we have room for one or more enthusiastic interns to join us for (at least) a couple of weeks <em>(preferably 4 days a week, any time between September 2017 to June 2018)</em>, to work as part of the CX Social development team. As an intern you are an integral part of the R&amp;D team working on different parts of the application using technologies like PHP, React, MySQL, Redis, memcached, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, a.o. The other team members include a designer, front-end developer, data scientist, and several system engineers &amp; full-stack web developers.<br />
We are looking for a student with interest and knowledge of both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>

<p>Want to hear from a previous intern what it’s like to join our team? Read about <a href="https://engagor.github.io/blog/2017/06/01/internship-gheerwijn-cx-social-developer/">Gheerwijn’s experiences</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-project%3A-achievements%21">The Project: Achievements!</h2>

<p>A big percentage of users work in our customer care tool full time, day-in day-out. So it’s important for us to keep the user experience for them smooth and enjoyable. We want to make the experience more fun by developing an achievement based system in the web-application.</p>

<p>Apart from making CX Social more fun for agents to work in, we aim to improve team work, increase retention and let users discover new features.</p>

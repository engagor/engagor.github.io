            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you could already read in <a href="/blog/2018/12/07/one-month-of-pairing">one of our previous posts</a>, we started working in pairs some time ago. Now there's also some Mob Programming being done from time to time, and we started automatically doing some things to make our own lives easier. Some examples:</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%9B%8B-%F0%9F%93%BA-make-yourself-comfortable">üõã üì∫ Make yourself comfortable</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2019-11-29-some-pairing-and-mobbing-take-aways/mobbing-team.jpg" alt="Keyboard Switcher in macOS" /></p>

<p>Make sure everyone has a good chair and good visibility of the screen you're working on. If you're pairing, this means that you should work on an external screen of some kind, instead of on a laptop. Make sure there's enough light, not too much noise, and that everyone has drinks and food if they need it.</p>

<p>You can work best if you're not focussing on something else. Taking away small distractions like restlessness or poor visibility of the screen can do wonders!</p>

<h2 id="%E2%8C%A8%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%92%BB-set-your-machine-up-for-everyone">‚å®Ô∏èüíª Set your machine up for everyone</h2>

<p>Make sure the machine you're working on is set up so that you can switch drivers often and so that every driver is working comfortably on it. Of course, it's mostly impossible to all agree on the same set of shortcuts and keyboard setups, but we found a great compromise:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-11-29-some-pairing-and-mobbing-take-aways/keyboard-switcher.png" alt="Keyboard Switcher in macOS" /></p>

<ul>
<li>On macOS you can make the keyboard settings available from the top bar so that you can really quickly switch keyboard layouts</li>
<li>In PhpStorm or other editors, there are options to export your settings and import other ones. I just created a backup of my settings by exporting them and I ask everyone at the beginning of the session to send me their configs. When they start, they can select their own config from my desktop! After the session I can easily restore my own settings.</li>
<li>On macOS it's also possible to connect multiple Bluetooth keyboards, mice, etc. We have an AZERTY and a QUERTY keyboard available, as well as a trackpad and a mouse. They are easily passed on and ready to use by the next driver!</li>
</ul>

<p>These three small changes come a long way to make you feel as if you're working on your own machine!</p>

<h2 id="%E2%9B%94%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%93%B1-only-allow-one-screen">‚õîÔ∏èüì± Only allow one screen</h2>

<p>Being distracted already came up in the previous tip, but here we go again! Ask everyone in the room to put their phones on silent and put them in their pockets. Ask them to close their laptops, they're not going to need them. If you need to look something up, or if you're unsure about what a given piece of code does, ask the driver to put it on the big screen.</p>

<p>This way, nobody dives off into their own cocoon and let their minds escape the group's focus.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%8E%A8%E2%97%BB%EF%B8%8F--to-the-drawing-board">üé®‚óªÔ∏è  To the drawing board</h2>

<p>Try to find a way to make things visible. If you have a whiteboard available, great! Do you have a wall? Use stickies or put up big pieces of paper. As a last resort, there's still just pieces of paper that you can draw on. Just make sure that you can make something visible so that you have something to talk about when a discussion is in order.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%98%B0-%E2%9E%A1-%F0%9F%98%81-keeping-everyone-engaged">üò∞ ‚û° üòÅ Keeping everyone engaged</h2>

<p>Two rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Switch drivers often</li>
<li>Take breaks often</li>
</ul>

<p>We use <a href="http://mobster.cc/">this simple app</a> to notify us when to switch and when to take breaks. If the app doesn't tell you to take a break but you feel like it anyway, just do it. You'll be more productive after the break.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%92%BB%F0%9F%8F%A1-remote-work-and-mobbing">üíªüè° Remote work and mobbing</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make sure both parties have a perfect internet connection</li>
<li>Make sure the setup for audio is working properly. We use a Jabra kit that picks up less ambient noise and makes everything clear to understand</li>
<li>Use e.g. Slack screen sharing features to your advantage: you can draw on the screen and you can switch drivers easily!</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope these takeaways can help you as well! Happy Mobbing!</p>

            <link href="/blog/2019/09/02/how-i-hacked-my-future-through-clarabridge"/>
            <updated>2019-09-02T11:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2019/09/02/how-i-hacked-my-future-through-clarabridge</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, Mohammed joined our Clarabridge Engage development team for an internship and he has since then become one of our full team members. This blog post is about his story and how <a href="https://hackyourfuture.be/">HackYourFuture.be</a> helped him find a place in our company, the technology industry of Gent, and ultimately Belgium.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThree years ago I decided to leave my homeland, after an exhausting period of war, destruction and loss. I left my family hoping to improve my future and achieve my ambition. 
  Belgium was my destination and by now I‚Äôm pretty sure that it was the right choice. When I got the Belgian residence I started to search for a job based on my resume in Palestine. I had graduated from the 'Information and Technology department' in Gaza, but I knew that I needed more experience and knowledge if I wanted to make it work here.‚Äù - Mohammed</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="my-experience-at-hackyourfuture">My Experience at HackYourFuture</h2>

<p>In his search for more education and building more experience, Mohammed was helped by the <a href="https://www.vdab.be/">VDAB</a>, Flanders‚Äô public employment service. They suggested he attend the HackYourFuture course.
HackYourFuture was founded in 2015 in Amsterdam, with the aim to enable refugees to build digital skills for a career in web development, facilitate the integration of newcomers, and address the shortage of qualified workforce in the IT sector, a shortage reflected by the amount of open positions we have here at <a href="http://clarabridge.com/careers">Clarabridge</a>.<br />
In May 2018, HackYourFuture Belgium launched its first class in Belgium with 13 highly motivated students, Mohammed being one of them.</p>

<p>Mohammed recalls the course was a perfect match for him for several reasons:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThe course covered programming languages with interesting modules (CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, React).  Each of the modules are taught by volunteer coaches with experience in the field of programming.‚Äú<br />
  ‚ÄúBecause the courses were given on Sundays, it allowed me extra spare time to continue my Dutch lessons and driving lessons. And although I‚Äôm learning Dutch, the fact that the lessons were taught in English helped me too.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<em>The first class of HackYourFuture Belgium</em>
</center></p>

<p>During 6 months the students followed these lessons and for the last 9 weeks they worked on a project together in smaller groups.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThe coaches of HackYourFuture were as excited as we were, because for most of them it was their first time teaching. During the week, when we studied and worked on our assignments, they were always available through Slack to answer our questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When asked about what makes the HackYourFuture bootcamp stand out from following any of the online courses plentifully available through the internet, Mohammed points to the team aspect:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúBy the final project we worked in groups of three, and every Sunday we divided the work between us. During the week we also kept in touch, and often we could use the HackYourFuture offices to work on the project.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mohammed‚Äôs project involved making a website for an institution from Brussels that would help homeless people and refugees to find the right information and help more easily. At the end of the course each team presented that project. At this graduation event one of our Clarabridge team members was also present.<br />
Of course, for the students, it now became real. Mohammed: ‚ÄúWe were worried about the next step, which would either be an internship or a job.‚Äù HackYourFuture assigned each student a mentor that would help the student take that next step.</p>

</center></p>

<h2 id="starting-the-internship-at-clarabridge">Starting the internship at Clarabridge</h2>

<p>This was the time when our company came into view for Mohammed. After having seen the projects at the HackYourFuture graduation event, we were impressed how far they got in only 9 weeks. We invited Mohammed for an interview, and his dedication immediately struck us. He explained what he was able to build, and what he learned at the HackYourFuture course, and this for us was the main deciding factor for offering an internship.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI was lucky to get a four month internship at <a href="https://www.clarabridge.com">Clarabridge</a> in Ghent, Belgium. I have learned new things every day, being surrounded by experienced and talented developers and engineers who are very helpful and very patient. They didn‚Äôt seem to get bored of my hundreds of questions.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When an intern joins our team, we first of all look for the right project to work on. The ideal project is typically a stand-alone new feature (so the scope of it is clearly defined), challenging enough (from a technical and product perspective), should have as less external factors as possible (so there‚Äôs as little roadblocks as possible), involves enough existing components of the codebase (to evaluate how easy a person finds their way), and most importantly: a project that results in something that we can take into production and is visual to our clients and team. Having that success experience of having your code shipped into production is something we always strive for.</p>

<p>Mohammed started his work on an importer-system that would allow our customers to upload an Excel file with a list of account related settings. The feature would mean a huge time-saver for customers who want to configure several canned responses, tags, or saved filters at once.<br />
Mohammed was assigned a specific mentor in our team as well (who helped on an almost daily basis), but the whole team got involved in reviewing parts of Mohammed‚Äôs code.</p>

</center></p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>

<p>Four months later, when this and several other projects of Mohammed's have been taken into production, we asked Mohammed what some of his main takeaways since his start in our team are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>üè† ‚ÄúWhen I started at Clarabridge, my main worry was that I had never written a line of PHP code in my life. I was wondering how I‚Äôd be able to get the hang of a complete language in only a couple of months. But actually, I quickly realised that learning PHP was the least of my concerns. Instead, my mentor and I focused a lot on how to write code using the principles of S.O.L.I.D. I probably learned more about programming trying to structure my code this way, than learning about language syntax.‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p>‚úÇÔ∏è ‚ÄúI always had to keep in mind that I was writing code for others. At some point in the future, another developer in the team will work on what I wrote, so I had to think wider and wiser, and take future uses and possibilities of my code into account. I refactored my code several times because of this.‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p>üî® ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sometimes tempting to fix an issue by writing code around it, but I realised that often this just causes a new issue. I try to to take more time to solve the problem at its root.‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p>üìö ‚ÄúWhen I started my internship, I read the blog posts on this <a href="https://engagor.github.io/">Clarabridge Developers Blog</a>. Unfortunately, I had a hard time understanding some of the content. A month later, I re-read them and could already understand more. Until this day, I keep reading the posts which didn‚Äôt make sense at that time. Being part of an ambitious team who reads a lot, encouraged me to learn and read more too.‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p>üëØ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs often a balance between trying to find the answer on your own, and avoiding to be stuck for too long, and eventually asking for help. Time is valuable.<br />
I started to trust my teammates‚Äô opinions, and worked on giving them a reason to trust me back. I learnt to avoid saying ‚ÄúI can do it alone‚Äù  or ‚ÄúIt is a piece of cake‚Äù. Instead I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to do it but I may need your help‚Äù. The team loves to help each other; so if you need help, just say it. When getting help from others, my teammates often had other personal perspectives. I learned to accept that, and picked from those that suited me. Eventually, by experience, you will have your own perspective.‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p>üëæ ‚ÄúNever underestimate another programmer, even if you know that you have more experience than him; always try to listen, discuss and understand. 
During the summer holidays, a talented 18 year old student joined our team. He didn‚Äôt know a lot about our application, but in a very short period of time he implemented more than 12 small improvements to the product. The whole team was impressed by what he has done. Because the improvements he worked on were smaller, easy to understand projects, I also learned from him by reviewing and checking his Pull Requests.‚Äù</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That the most important lessons Mohammed lists are mainly about communication and how to learn from others, and the impact of that on how your code is structured, really show he‚Äôs become an integral part of our development team. It‚Äôs also a testament to the way a product is always built by a team of people (and not a single 10x engineer).
So it‚Äôs no surprise that the project Mohammed is currently helping to build is one of our most requested features.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-next%2C-and-how-can-you-help%3F">What is next, and how can you help?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúFor me, HackYourFuture was my starting point. I was invited to be an assistant coach in the upcoming course - now at its fourth edition already. For me this is a great opportunity to pay back some of their generosity, and of course to continue learning.‚Äù - Mohammed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Know that HackYourFuture is run by volunteers. They are always on the lookout for people who work with challenging technologies in innovative companies. If you feel like sharing some of your knowledge with the students, maybe think about <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSef3OH8546MJNllcvrv7KomHelqzrKNpnLRVbI1ZqbeajnluA/viewform">becoming a coach</a>?<br />
Helping as a coach can mean giving a few lessons, but also just being around when the students do their work, and trying to help out where possible.<br />
Know that HackYourFuture is not only about programming, it‚Äôs also a real <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HackYFutureBE/">community</a> supporting and helping each other to start a new career in Belgium.</p>

<p><center>

<em>HackYourFuture Coaches</em>
</center></p>

<p>If you‚Äôre a company interested in hiring some of the graduates, we hope Mohammed‚Äôs story helps. We can attest that the students are trained to perform well as junior web developers in a modern IT team, write clean code, and think like problem solvers. From this experience we especially remember the student‚Äôs eagerness to learn and start a development career.</p>

<h2 id="mohammed-thanks">Mohammed thanks</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúClarabridge is my home now, so one of my responsibilities is to make it bigger and keep it safe and shining.<br />
  With this post, I also want to thank everyone who helped me through my journey, by encouraging words or advice, or even a smile.<br />
  Thanks HackYourFuture and all of the coaches who showed the way for us, especially Frederik De Bleser who believed in me and kept giving me advice even after the course.<br />
  Thanks to my mentors at Clarabridge: Anthony, Toon and Cedric. And the other teammates who didn‚Äôt hesitate when I asked for help: Jenne, Gheerwijn, Thibaut, Thomas, Jared, Jasper, Hans and Erik. And thanks to Jurriaan who gave me the opportunity to be one of his team members, and for being a human before being a team leader.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="want-to-join-the-course%2C-or-do-an-internship-too%3F">Want to join the course, or do an internship too?</h2>

<p>If you feel like joining a HackYourFuture course, know they always accept applications. <em>(The 6th course is starting in a few days!)</em><br />
And of course, we also invite recent graduates or others interested in doing an internship in our team, to <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;l&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#106;&#x75;&#x72;&#114;&#105;a&#x61;&#110;&#46;p&#x65;&#x72;&#115;&#121;&#x6e;&#x40;&#99;&#108;a&#x72;&#x61;&#98;&#114;&#x69;&#x64;&#103;&#101;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#109;">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>Jurriaan liked this blog post. We're developers, software engineers, programmers. We're not only specialized in a framework! What we study is the way of solving problems, and frameworks are merely tools for our craft. This is valuable advice that has been given to us over the years, and people new to development tend to forget.</p>

<h3 id="the-end-of-silex"><a href="https://symfony.com/blog/the-end-of-silex">The End Of Silex</a></h3>

<p>We're sad to see our favorite "framework as a library" go, but it's safe to say that it served its purpose incredibly well. Thanks Silex!</p>

<p>The way BBC reporters used social media and readily available tools like Google Maps to investigate this War Crime is really impressive. The power of social media is confirmed yet again.</p>

<p>Ursula thinks this is a fascinating read about how social media was used for the "repeal the 8th campaign" in Ireland. It compares to how Trump used social media too... Relevant to the times!</p>

<p>Plugged by Toon, this is a lengthy explanation of why Stuxnet might be the most advanced piece of code ever written. Even if you don't agree, it's a very nice read!</p>

<p>Those were some of our highlights for 2018, have a great 2019!</p>

            <updated>2018-12-07T16:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2018/12/07/one-month-of-pairing</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you could already read in some of our <a href="/blog/2017/05/22/implementing-little-big-details-on-offsite-bootcamp">previous</a> <a href="/blog/2017/03/01/batman-chatman">blogposts</a>, we are a relatively small team, with some loose rules for working together. Up until one month ago, everyone just picked a project from the roadmap and started implementing, and there was a rotation system within the team to always have two people available to help out our support team to assess bugs &amp; fix issues respectively.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%92%AD%F0%9F%98%B0-about-silos-%26-issue-fatigue">üí≠üò∞ About Silos &amp; Issue-Fatigue</h2>

<p>As you can imagine, this works really well for projects that are small and well defined, and for teams where everyone is of the same skill level, and has the same development practices. People are not in each other's ways, and you can "horizontally scale" your team. The only trouble is, we're a small team, we have senior and junior developer profiles, and our projects are mostly not so small. The result of this, is that the person implementing a feature is most likely the only one that <strong>really</strong> knows the feature inside out. So the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> for every feature was basically 1. For some features we had insane knowledge silos.</p>

<p>There's a similar story to the support rotation system within the team: the people talking to support and fixing bugs most likely didn't implement the features where the bugs appeared. If they did, the bugs were quickly fixed, and if not, people had to try and understand code written by someone else that they'd never seen <strong>over and over</strong> again. Not ideal. And the result was that for me personally, weeks when I was Batman (yes that's how we call the lucky engineer that's solving bugs that week) were the most draining periods of the year.</p>

<h2 id="%E2%9A%97%EF%B8%8F%F0%9F%94%AC-the-experiment">‚öóÔ∏èüî¨ The Experiment</h2>

<p>We do weekly roundups, and after an exhausting week of being Batman, I, expressed my feelings towards the Silos and the Batman weeks. The whole team actually agreed that the situation was not perfect, and we decided it was time for an experiment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Split up the (already small) team in two groups of people (3 to 4 people per group) that will always try to work together on the same feature.</li>
<li>Start every day together with your team (at the same computer or over <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack">Slack Voice Calls</a>) trying to solve issues or create features using Pair Programming techniques. Split up the team for "monkey-jobs".</li>
<li>Both teams provide one team member per week to be Batman or Robin. They form their own team and tackle bugs together.</li>
</ul>

<p>We limited the scope of the experiment to the winter release, so 3 months. So far we did a (very limited) retrospective every week.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%91%A9%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%92%BB%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%92%BB-what-have-we-learned-so-far%3F">üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª What have we learned so far?</h2>

<p>We've only been doing this for 4 weeks, so I might be jumping to conclusions here. So far the experience has been positive!</p>

<ul>
<li>It's great to be able to verify your ideas immediately, and to try and build a shared understanding of the problem you're working on.</li>
<li>Pair Programming is exhausting, but it works! We feel the velocity gain and the concentration boost. We find that we're writing better code. We feel productive.</li>
<li>We're aware that it's exhausting and we take a lot of breaks, stop early when we're tired.</li>
<li>We're using Slack as team communication tool, and when someone is working at home, we can just keep Pair Programming because of the built-in voice calls and screen sharing. Slack even allows you to share your mouse and keyboard with the person at the other side of the call (that is, if you've installed Slack from their website instead of from the App Store).</li>
<li>We found this great blogpost with some basics to <a href="https://madewithlove.be/how-to-keep-pair-programming-digestible/">keep Pair Programming digestible</a>, by my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/woutersioen">Wouter Sioen</a>.</li>
<li>We've done some ad-hoc pair programming in the past, but starting the day at the same computer really helps you keep it up and encourages you to do it more often.</li>
<li>Batman and Robin are <em>way faster</em> at finding and fixing bugs than when they were working alone. Having that extra developer by your side improves your bug finding experience massively. When working alone, overlooking a small mistake could take up hours, while your pair could spot that in seconds. Our CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/oemebamo">Jurriaan Persyn</a> pointed out that we've fixed a third more issues than last month, even some that were open for a long time already!</li>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="what-do-we-do%3F">What do we do?</h2>

<p>The Clarabrige Engage team builds a customer care tool for social media. Our clients use our software to be able to respond to the incoming questions and complaints on their Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, Instagram profiles, a.o. These clients often have a high volume of incoming messages, on several social profiles. We try to make those people‚Äôs lives easier by offering automation tools, smart routing of messages and reply suggestions, among others.
<a href="https://developers.engagor.com/team">Read more about what we do here</a>.</p>

<p>As of September 2018, we have room for one or more enthusiastic interns to join us for (at least) a couple of weeks <em>(preferably 4 days a week, any time between September 2018 to June 2019)</em>, to work as part of the Clarabrige Engage development team.</p>

<h2 id="the-project%3A-skill-based-routing%21">The Project: Skill based routing!</h2>

<p>We‚Äôre looking for someone to help us solve this problem for our clients; When a new question or complaints comes in, a customer care agent will handle that complaint; but which agent? Clarabrige Engage offers several ways and algorithms that can help decide which questions go to which agent at a certain time, but there is still room for improvement ‚Ä¶ Ideally we want to assign the question to the agent that will be able to handle &amp; answer the question adequately in the shortest amount of time. Several factors are at play here: properties of the question, metadata about the question, metadata from who‚Äôs asking, which agents are available, skills of those agents, which mailboxes they work in, etc. We want you to look for ways how we can optimize our current algorithms and help us to implement them.</p>

<p>Here's a real-world example: a question in French about billing comes in 5 minutes before the end of the Paris team shift. Who will handle this question?</p>

</center></p>

<p>We will provide labeled data and statistics about agent performance. It‚Äôs up to you to figure out the best approach, with our help of course.</p>

<h2 id="the-internship">The Internship</h2>

<p>As an intern you are an integral part of the R&amp;D team working on different parts of the application using technologies like PHP, React, MySQL, Redis, memcached, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ, a.o. The other team members include a designer, front-end developer, data scientist, and several system engineers &amp; full-stack web developers.
We are looking for a student with interest and knowledge of both front-end as back-end technologies.</p>

            <link href="/blog/2018/04/09/some-tips-for-distraction-free-programming"/>
            <updated>2018-04-09T17:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2018/04/09/some-tips-for-distraction-free-programming</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm very easily distracted. The slightest movement or conversation in the room takes my focus right away, not to mention the endless stream of information and notifications that e.g. services like Slack (team chat) and e-mail generate. I might be working on something with a colleague or on my own, when a simple notification pops in. My brain glitches for a moment while I process the notification and get back to where I was, but it's enough to completely lose focus. When pair programming with someone that isn't easily distracted, it's mostly fixed in an instant by getting back to the conversation or repeating the last question, but it's a lot more difficult when working on a feature alone. Over time I tried to change a few things to make this kind of interruptions less frequent or pervasive. Let's check some out:</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%8F%9D-environment">üèù Environment</h2>

<p>The room I'm working in has a huge impact on my concentration levels. People talking or walking around are direct hits, as is any movement in my surroundings, even behind me. This is mostly fixed in our case since we don't have an open floor plan, so we don't share rooms with other teams, and when it's noisy in the room next to ours, we can just close the door. To prevent people talking from disrupting my concentration and the other way around, I'll put on headphones when working alone (mostly to prevent myself from listening in on the conversation), and I'll move to another room when pair programming. I know it sounds antisocial and makes me less approachable for questions or consultation, but I try to only do this when there's noise.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%93%B1-phone-%26-social-media">üì± Phone &amp; Social Media</h2>

<p>My phone is out of sight. When I get a message I will read it when I find the time. When someone calls me I mostly take the call. It might sound strange because we're a social media company, but I'm not logged in to any of my personal social media accounts during the day. This really helps me concentrate, because my Twitter timeline is a real timesink for me. If I'm looking at that, I'm certainly not concentrating üòè. For testing stuff, I'll aways use test accounts.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%96%A5-full-screen-applications">üñ• Full Screen Applications</h2>

<p>Although I don't like Full Screen Applications, I started using them more and more. They hide anything that might be happening in other windows, covering unwanted distractions up until you switch to the other application. I still don't like the oversight that is taken away by using an app in Full Screen mode though. The cool thing for me specifically is that iTerm behaves a bit like a tiling window manager for me, since I do most of my development in Vim &amp; the terminal, using iTerm splits. A great tip there is that you can use <code>Cmd + Shift + Enter</code> in an iTerm split to make it appear Full Screen temporarily.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%9B%8E-osx-notification-center">üõé OSX Notification center</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2018-04-09-some-tips-for-distraction-free-programming/1.png" alt="do not disturb" /></p>

<p>I already hinted at it earlier on, but notifications of any kind really disturb me. They pop over any fullscreen application that might be open, and I really can't help looking at them. This is why I set the <code>DO NOT DISTURB</code> mode on during workdays. You can configure Mac OSX to enable it by default during work hours, or you can do it manually when you notice being distracted. Notifications I get are mostly from Slack, Calendar and Mail. You can also configure this on a per-application basis in your System Preferences.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%8E%88-osx-application-badges">üéà OSX Application Badges</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2018-04-09-some-tips-for-distraction-free-programming/2.png" alt="dock icons with badges" /></p>

<p>What's really annoying me is that Mac OS displays so-called "badges" -the red circle icons with a number in them- on applications that received notifications, and these badges are visible in the Dock and the Application Switcher (<code>Cmd + Tab</code>). When I'm switching to my browser, I don't want to see how many Slack messages I missed. I'll check those later. I just went to Notification Center in System Preferences and disabled these badges for Slack, Calendar and Mail. I believe that I can be more productive when I read these things periodically instead of during other tasks. In the screenshot above, I enabled them temporarily for Calendar to show you what I mean, but what you can't see is that I have 25+ unread messages in Slack. Don't worry, I'll read them after I get this blogpost out! üòâ</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%93%A2-slack">üì¢ Slack</h2>

<p>Some great things to do in Slack are to Leave channels you don't use, and to use the Mute üîá functionality on channels that are not urgent but you can't really leave. Of course, I disabled Slack's notification sounds by default.</p>

<p>I hope these tips were helpful, they certainly help me concentrate a bit better. If you think of anything else, comment below, I want to hear it! Happy pair programming!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a team, we consume A LOT of blog posts, YouTube videos, podcasts, and tweets about software development and related topics each year. We asked everyone in the team to share their favorite stuff that they found online, so that you can read it too. Here we go!</p>

<h1 id="people-%26-community">People &amp; Community</h1>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/pTY9EtkiakcU/giphy.gif" alt="The Blind" /></p>

<h3 id="in-the-kingdom-of-the-blind"><a href="https://bridgetkromhout.com/blog/in-the-kingdom-of-the-blind/">In The Kingdom Of The Blind</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you can imagine, there are plenty of reasons that under-represented people in tech aren't going to jump the second your event's CFP opens. But submissions will pour in nonetheless... from the folks whose (devrel/marketing/field engineer) vendor job includes public speaking (and on-the-job time to fine-tune their abstracts). And spoiler alert, many of them will fall into the majority cis het white male demographic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ursula recommends this for the great ideas on how to improve diversity at conferences, and an excellent candid overview of the reasons why underrepresented minorities do not speak at or attend tech conferences as often.</p>

<h3 id="we-fired-our-top-talent.-best-decision-we-ever-made."><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-fired-our-top-talent-best-decision-we-ever-made-4c0a99728fde">We fired our top talent. Best decision we ever made.</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your team's strength is not a function of the talent of individual members. It's a function of their collaboration, tenacity, and mutual respect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hans likes this because when there's a smart guy around, you'll find it tempting to just go ask him instead of trying to do the research yourself and learn something new. He doesn't like developers who think that they know everything. They don't. In fact, you'll never know everything. Sharing knowledge and working together as a team is something we should focus on instead. Each person has their own strengths.</p>

<h3 id="the-myth-of-the-%22cool-tech-girl%22"><a href="https://code.likeagirl.io/the-myth-of-the-cool-tech-girl-7868fa63769b">The myth of the "cool tech girl"</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't reward good behaviour with scotch, don't tap kegs at 12pm, and don't host video game or ping pong tournaments. Don't call your employees "rockstars". Shine a harsh light on some of your internal slack channels. If your company doesn't perpetuate the kind of culture that makes women feel like they need to be 'one of the boys', they won't need the coping mechanism of the "cool tech girl".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ursula has seen this type of behaviour from women in tech in many countries. "I would almost go as far as to say that if you don't fit into the 'cool tech girl' box, it's difficult to survive. As a woman in tech I think you have a responsibility to speak up for diversity in the industry. It's really hard, and it's great to hear viewpoints that identify that."</p>

<h3 id="transactions-redefined"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqKNqIsB8_k">Transactions Redefined</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Event Storming is my pizza, you can add your toppings, as long as it's not database tables or pineapple</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Toon recommends this because Alberto Brandolini is a great speaker, and his vision on Domain Driven Design and software development in general is really clear and deep. He goes a long way to understand the business, and the problems associated with the business. He goes out of his way to find out how he can solve them.</p>

<h3 id="modern-software-over-engineering-mistakes"><a href="https://medium.com/@rdsubhas/10-modern-software-engineering-mistakes-bc67fbef4fc8">Modern Software Over-Engineering Mistakes</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Duplication is better than the wrong abstraction</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jurriaan likes this because too much of technical literature is about how you should start doing things, and how everything you‚Äôve done in the past is probably wrong. This article captures the essence of trying to architect real-life development projects.</p>

<h3 id="kubernetes-at-github"><a href="https://githubengineering.com/kubernetes-at-github/">Kubernetes at Github</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a self-service application provisioning workflow in place, SRE can devote more of our time to delivering infrastructure products to the rest of the engineering organisation in support of our best practices, building toward a faster and more resilient GitHub experience for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeffry liked this because everybody and their dog are rethinking how to do platform now that the technology to do so has matured. This write-up from Github offers a great look into the decision making and preparation that goes into gradually building up confidence. He gives the author additional points for sprinkling snippets of inspiration throughout the post: e.g. chatops-rpc to make our hubot do more than offer drunk commentary, Kelsey Hightower's "Kubernetes the hard way" which he has set his mind to working through over the holidays, flipper and mission control bar and simulating kernel panics with sysrq-trigger.</p>

<h1 id="think-differently">Think Differently</h1>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ximCDHoBlx4UU/giphy.gif" alt="Excel on mobile, epic experience" /></p>

<h3 id="exploring-time"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm95cYAtAa8">Exploring Time</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>It‚Äôs impossible to know if this talk started on time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Toon recommends this because Eric Evans uses his own Domain Driven Design to explore better ways to think about time. Very inspiring. He shows how "generic" subdomains of software development are not generally "solved problems", and how you can make a difference there, as a programmer.</p>

<h3 id="clojure-for-the-brave-and-true"><a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/">Clojure for the Brave and True</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Humor has a certain relationship to seriousness. It is appropriate to joke about serious things, but only after the right amount of time has passed. For example, it took years for me to be able to crack a smile when I remember my favorite uncle‚Äôs last words: "Hold my beer".</p>
  
  <p>I'm so proud of you, little teapot. You've run your first Clojure program! Not only that, but you've become acquainted with the REPL, one of the most important tools for developing Clojure software. Amazing!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Niek thinks this book is a hilarious and down-to-earth explanation of yet another programming language to learn. Clojure is a Lisp dialect and will melt your brain with its elegance!</p>

<h3 id="you-suck-at-excel"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nbkaYsR94c">You Suck At Excel</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This material is -I guess- kinda like basic to intermediate, but for you all it's going to be stupid hard, so try paying attention and don't slow me down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Toon enjoyed this because this guy solves real world problems for people using Excel. "I learned a 100 things from seeing him work like this." He knows Excel inside out.</p>

<h3 id="lemme-tell-you-about-the-most-successful-program-i-ever-wrote"><a href="https://twitter.com/revin/status/940700486117634050">Lemme tell you about the most successful program I ever wrote</a></h3>

<h6 id="twitter-thread">(twitter thread)</h6>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was the first time I genuinely understood that users don't care how something is implemented; they care how it makes them feel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hans thinks we put so much effort in making our application code clean and future-proof while just a tiny poorly written program (that works) can make someone really happy. Software can seem magical for some people.</p>

<h1 id="big-data">Big Data</h1>

<p>Jasper likes this because it's incredible how much data a festival organizer track and save about you with just a bracelet, and also, what they (can possibly) do with it.</p>

<h3 id="deep-learning-for-chatbots"><a href="http://www.wildml.com/2016/07/deep-learning-for-chatbots-2-retrieval-based-model-tensorflow/">Deep Learning for Chatbots</a></h3>

  <p>Generative models are an active area of research, but we‚Äôre not quite there yet. If you want to build a conversational agent today your best bet is most likely a retrieval-based model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Niek checked this out because it was exactly the right content for his reply suggestions adventure, a feature he is working on for Clarabrige Engage.</p>

<p>Those were our highlights for 2017, let us know if we missed something!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've been using Value Objects more and more over the years, and although there's a lot of info out there, there are some things that we found particularly interesting to talk about in a blog post.</p>

<h2 id="what%27s-a-value-object%3F">What's a Value Object?</h2>

<p>Value Objects are simply put <em>objects that represent a value</em>, i.e. objects that don't have an identity except for the value they represent. Very frequently used examples are <code>Money</code> (if someone owes me â‚¬5 and they pay me â‚¬2 + â‚¬2 + â‚¬1 I'm happy) and <code>DateTime</code>, but there are lots of things that would qualify. For instance, combined values like a <code>TimeSlot</code> which comprises of two <code>DateTime</code> objects <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>, which is equal to another <code>TimeSlot</code> object if both <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> for both <code>TimeSlot</code> objects are equal. Or points in a 2D plane with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates, where -you guessed it- two points are equal if both points have the same <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates.</p>

<p>A lot of people wonder why they should use Value Objects, instead of passing around primitive values. Let's take some user input in the form of a telephone number, and treat it as a <code>String</code>. We want to pass it around in our code. Somewhere in our code there's a function that expects a telephone number as a parameter. How can it be sure that we passed a telephone number? It can't... Since we're just passing around a <code>String</code>, it needs to do some checks: Does the string look like a telephone number? Does it have a valid country code? etc. The next function that takes a telephone number as a parameter needs to do these checks again. There are some rules about what makes a valid telephone number, which can't be encapsulated in the <code>String</code> representation. If we make a specialized object to represent that phone number, we we can check these rules upon creation of the object, and thus prevent invalid state before it occurs. If some part of our code now gets that <code>PhoneNumber</code> object, it can be sure that it's a valid phone number.</p>

<h2 id="yes%2C-value-objects-should-be-immutable">Yes, Value Objects should be immutable</h2>

<p>Earlier we said that <code>DateTime</code> is a Value Object. Since a <code>DateTime</code> is just a value, once it is instantiated it should represent that value. Let's check something out:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$noon1 = new DateTime('today noon');
$noon2 = new DateTime('today noon');
var_dump($noon1 == $noon2); // bool(true)

$noon3 = $noon1-&gt;modify('+ 2 hours');

var_dump($noon1 == $noon2); // bool(false)
</code></pre>

<p>What happened? I instantiated two <code>DateTime</code> objects that were equal to each other, representing "today at noon". I created a third <code>DateTime</code> object that should represent "today, two hours later than noon". After that, one of the objects that represented "noon" a second ago doesn't anymore. It's like saying: "here you have a 3", and when you start calculating with it, it changed to a 4. This essentially teleported us to another universe where 3 means 4 suddenly.</p>

<p>The reason this happened is because of the fact that the <code>-&gt;modify()</code> call mutates the <code>DateTime</code> object. If we prevent our objects from being changed (make them immutable), they will become a lot safer to work with. In this regard, you should probably always use <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/class.datetimeimmutable.php"><code>DateTimeImmutable</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-introduce-a-value-object%3F">How to introduce a Value Object?</h2>

<p>Let's say we have some code that takes a user's <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/twitter-username-rules">Twitter handle</a> to perform some operations:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class Twitter
{
    public function publicTimelineFor(string $handle)
    {
        $this-&gt;assertValidTwitterHandle($handle);

        // ... fetch &amp; return timeline
    }

    public function tweepsFollowing(string $handle)
    {
        $this-&gt;assertValidTwitterHandle($handle);

        // ... fetch &amp; return followers
    }

    /**
     * @param string $handle
     *
     * @throws InvalidArgumentException when not valid
     */
    private function assertValidTwitterHandle(string $handle)
    {
        // check the rules here, throw exception if not valid
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>assertValidTwitterHandle()</code> must happen in every call that uses the concept of a Twitter handle, but it's so easy to forget when you write a new function! Also, it's impossible to know if a given string has been approved in a previous call. If you now call <code>publicTimelineFor($handle)</code> and <code>tweepsFollowing($handle)</code> in succession for the same <code>$handle</code>, you're basically repeating yourself for no reason. Let's refactor this!</p>

<p>The first thing that you want to do is make sure you get your code under test (it should already be that way ðŸ˜˜). What I like to do in this case, is at least have some tests for what a "valid Twitter handle" means. Since I'll be working towards an object that can only represent a valid Twitter handle, I'll make the <code>private</code> assertion <code>public</code>, write some unit tests against the assertion, and be done with it. We'll change the test later on.</p>

<pre><code class="php">class TwitterHandleTest extends \PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    public function setUp()
    {
        $this-&gt;twitter = new Twitter();
    }

    /**
     * @expectedException InvalidArgumentException
     */
    public function test_it_throws_when_longer_than_16_chars()
    {
        $this-&gt;twitter-&gt;assertValidTwitterHandle('@VeryVeryVeryLongHandleThatShouldThrow');
    }

    // Tests for other rules go here too
    // - handle is a string and should start with '@'
    // - handle contains only uppercase chars, lowercase chars, digits and underscores
    // - make sure to provide some happy path cases as well
    // - you can of course use data providers in your tests to test multiple examples per test
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then create a very basic class for our Value Object:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class TwitterHandle
{
    private $handle;

    public function __construct(string $handle)
    {
        $this-&gt;assertValidTwitterHandle($handle);

        $this-&gt;handle = $handle;
    }

    private function assertValidTwitterHandle(string $handle)
    {
        // check the rules here, throw exception if not valid
    }

    public function __toString(): string
    {
        return $this-&gt;handle;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I created a basic class with the Twitter handle as a string as a constructor parameter. If we use the class as a string, it will cast to the exact Twitter handle as a string that we got as input. This is a temporary measure. I then just moved the <code>assertValidTwitterHandle()</code> method from the <code>Twitter</code> class to <code>TwitterHandle</code>, and made it private. I can fix my tests by just using the constructor of the <code>TwitterHandle</code> class as entry point:</p>

<pre><code class="php">/**
 * @expectedException InvalidArgumentException
 */
public function test_it_throws_when_longer_than_16_chars()
{
    new TwitterHandle('@VeryVeryVeryLongHandleThatShouldThrow');
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code that used to work with handlers in the string form can now easily be changed to accept our object:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function publicTimelineFor(TwitterHandle $handle)
{
    // ... fetch &amp; return timeline
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we just typehint on the Value Object in the function definition, and since the <code>__toString()</code> method is defined to return the same string as we had before, everything just keeps working. With the one perk that the check for valid handles is gone from all our functions! We don't need it anymore, since it's now impossible to pass an invalid handle to them! Now you just need to handle the case of the invalid Twitter handle the moment you get it from the user.</p>

<p>As a final measure, I make sure that the output from the <code>__toString()</code> method can always be parsed back into the same Value Object again, by just giving it to the constructor. In this case that means that I need to return the complete value that the object was instantiated with (which is already the case). If you're tempted to use the <code>__toString()</code> method for other presentational purposes, <a href="http://verraes.net/2013/02/2013-02-16-casting-value_objects/#1-dont-use-_tostring-for-presentation">you're advised to create a specific function for that</a>.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-value-objects">Comparing Value Objects</h2>

<p>Let's say we want to represent points in a <code>x</code> by <code>y</code> two-dimentional plane using a <code>Point</code> Value Object. We've got something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class Point
{
    private $x;
    private $y;

    public function __construct(int $x, int $y)
    {
        $this-&gt;x = $x;
        $this-&gt;y = $y;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Comparing two of these <code>Point</code>s for equality is easy. We can just use PHP's built-in <code>==</code>, which will compare the objects by the values of their properties (exactly what we want for now).</p>

<pre><code class="php">$c1 = new Point(10, 20);
$c2 = new Point(10, 30);
$c3 = new Point(10, 20);

var_dump($c1 == $c2); // false
var_dump($c1 == $c3); // true
</code></pre>

<p>This gets more complicated when we want to e.g. calculate the distance between two <code>Point</code>s. Aren't those <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties private to the object?</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class Point
{
    private $x;
    private $y;

    public function __construct(int $x, int $y)
    {
        $this-&gt;x = $x;
        $this-&gt;y = $y;
    }

    public function distanceTo(Point $other): float
    {
        return sqrt(pow($this-&gt;x - $other-&gt;x, 2) + pow($this-&gt;y - $other-&gt;y, 2));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yes. But since these are two objects of the same type, they can access each other private properties! The code above just works! Be careful though, that you don't change any properties (and therefore make the objects mutable...).</p>

<h2 id="nested-value-objects">Nested Value Objects</h2>

<p>With the <code>Point</code> Value Object that we defined above, we can go a little bit further and represent other things in 2D planes, e.g. line segments, which are defined by two points A and B:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class LineSegment
{
    private $a;
    private $b;

    public function __construct(Point $a, Point $b)
    {
        $this-&gt;a = $a;
        $this-&gt;b = $b;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we just created a Value Object that encapsulates two other Value Objects. This is great, we can successfully represent a <code>LineSegment</code> with this, but there's a problem with this:</p>

<p>The math (the domain in this case) tells us that two line segments are equal if they have the same delimiting points. In our case, we called them <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code>, but actually, the order is not important. This means the <code>==</code> check I described above won't work like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$pointA = new Point(0, 0);
$pointB = new Point(5, 5);

$line1 = new LineSegment($pointA, $pointB);
$line2 = new LineSegment($pointB, $pointA);

var_dump($line1 == $line2); // false
</code></pre>

<p>We can solve that problem using an <code>equals()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class LineSegment
{
    private $a;
    private $b;

    public function __construct(Point $a, Point $b)
    {
        $this-&gt;a = $a;
        $this-&gt;b = $b;
    }

    public function equals(LineSegment $other): bool
    {
        return ($this-&gt;a == $other-&gt;a &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;b == $other-&gt;b)
            || ($this-&gt;a == $other-&gt;b &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;b == $other-&gt;a);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This can now be used to compare lines, but the <code>==</code> still gives wrong results. This is the point where I tell you <code>==</code> is not the best thing to use with Objects in PHP. You cannot override it, or make it work in all cases. It actually breaks encapsulation and checks private properties of objects. But we still want to make it work so that if it gets used instead of the <code>equals()</code> method, nothing breaks. We can then use a rule in our static analysis tools to check for <code>==</code> used with our object. We can make the <code>==</code> work using a fixed order in which point A and B get assigned inside <code>LineSegment</code>'s constructor:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class LineSegment
{
    // ...

    public function __construct(Point $a, Point $b)
    {
        $this-&gt;a = $a;
        $this-&gt;b = $b;

        if ($a-&gt;greaterThan($b)) {
            $this-&gt;a = $b;
            $this-&gt;b = $a;
        }
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our <code>Point</code> objects now need the <code>greaterThan()</code> method, which can be implemented a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class Point
{
    // ...

    public function greaterThan(Point $other): bool
    {
        if ($this-&gt;x == $other-&gt;x) {
            return $this-&gt;y &gt; $other-&gt;y;
        }

        return $this-&gt;x &gt; $other-&gt;x;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can simplify <code>LineSegment</code>'s <code>equals()</code> method, since <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code> will be assigned in order:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class LineSegment
{
    // ...

    public function equals(LineSegment $other): bool
    {
        return $this-&gt;a == $other-&gt;a &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;b == $other-&gt;b;
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even though we don't want people to use <code>==</code> with our <code>LineSegment</code> Value Object, we made it work. Like this, we can prevent unexpected errors in our code. The final code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class Point
{
    private $x;
    private $y;

    public function __construct(int $x, int $y)
    {
        $this-&gt;x = $x;
        $this-&gt;y = $y;
    }

    public function distanceTo(Point $other): float
    {
        return sqrt(pow($this-&gt;x - $other-&gt;x, 2) + pow($this-&gt;y - $other-&gt;y, 2));
    }

    public function greaterThan(Point $other): bool
    {
        if ($this-&gt;x == $other-&gt;x) {
            return $this-&gt;y &gt; $other-&gt;y;
        }

        return $this-&gt;x &gt; $other-&gt;x;
    }
}

final class LineSegment
{
    private $a;
    private $b;

    public function __construct(Point $a, Point $b)
    {
        $this-&gt;a = $a;
        $this-&gt;b = $b;

        if ($a-&gt;greaterThan($b)) {
            $this-&gt;a = $b;
            $this-&gt;b = $a;
        }
    }

    public function equals(LineSegment $other): bool
    {
        return $this-&gt;a == $other-&gt;a &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;b == $other-&gt;b;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we wanted to represent the nested Value Objects as a string, e.g. to be able to save them in a field in the database, we could just make the <code>Point</code> represent itself as <code>(x, y)</code> and the <code>LineSegment</code> as <code>[(Xa, Ya), (Xb, Yb)]</code> by letting the <code>LineSegment</code>'s <code>__toString</code> method call that of the nested <code>Point</code> objects. For parsing the string representation back into a <code>LineSegment</code>, we'll need a <code>fromString()</code> <a href="http://verraes.net/2014/06/named-constructors-in-php/">alternative constructor</a> that can parse those strings and instantiate the correct objects for them, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader!</p>

<p>So, these were our take-aways after introducing Value Objects into our codebase. Did we forget something?</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How many times have you seen code like this?</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders()
{
    $coffeeRuns = $this-&gt;coffeeRunsRepository-&gt;getAll();
    $openForOrders = array();

    foreach ($coffeeRuns as $coffeeRun) {
        if ($coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade()) {
            $openForOrders[] = $coffeeRun;
        }
    }

    return $openForOrders;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our office is very close to a <a href="http://simon-says.be/">great coffee bar</a>, and people are going there from time to time to get coffee for everyone in the office. Keeping track of who's going for coffee and who wants which coffee can be daunting, which is why I'm making this app. Let's take a closer look at that piece of code.</p>

<p>We're manually traversing an array of <code>CoffeeRun</code> objects that we got out of the Repository to filter out those who are open for orders. If we find one, we add it to a new array. This way we build a list of <code>CoffeeRuns</code> that are still accepting orders.</p>

<h2 id="to-iterator-or-not%2C-that%27s-the-question">To Iterator or not, that's the question</h2>

<p>Now, there's nothing very wrong with this, but it could be made a whole lot better, I think. Let's say that the Repository contains 1000 <code>CoffeeRun</code>s. We're now forcing the Repository to return an array of 1000 <code>CoffeeRun</code> objects when we call <code>getAll()</code>. That's not great. But let's think about it... The Repository already represents a list of all <code>CoffeeRun</code> objects. Why can't we just iterate over it? Something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders()
{
    $coffeeRuns = $this-&gt;coffeeRunsRepository;
    $openForOrders = array();

    foreach ($coffeeRuns as $coffeeRun) {
        if ($coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade()) {
            $openForOrders[] = $coffeeRun;
        }
    }

    return $openForOrders;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Having a repository we can iterate over like that would already be a first step. We could implement the <code>Iterator</code> interface within the Repository, and have this functionality immediately. But that would leave the foreach out there, and that would also present a problem for our dependency injection: the class where this <code>displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders</code> is a controller, and it has the Repository injected in its constructor, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function __construct(CoffeeRunsRepository $repository)
{
    $this-&gt;coffeeRunsRepository = $repository;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we'd count on the fact that the Repository is now an <code>Iterator</code>, we should either typehint on it, but then we lose our typehint for <code>CoffeeRunsRepository</code>, which we don't want. Or we could make the <code>CoffeeRunsRepository</code> interface extend the <code>Iterator</code> interface, but then we get a really big interface we need to implement for every implementation of the Repository. Both of which are annoying to say the least.</p>

<h2 id="think-solidly-different">Think SOLIDly Different</h2>

<p>Let's try something completely different. In fact, the <code>foreach</code> in that method, is blocking progress for us right now; Let's extract that whole block to a method. This is what was in the controller before the extraction:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders()
{
    $coffeeRuns = $this-&gt;coffeeRunsRepository-&gt;getAll();
    $openForOrders = array();

    foreach ($coffeeRuns as $coffeeRun) {
        if ($coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade()) {
            $openForOrders[] = $coffeeRun;
        }
    }

    return $openForOrders;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the Repository we added a new method <code>openForOrders()</code>, and we kept the same implementation as before, which now resides in the implementation of that method:</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface CoffeeRunsRepository
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @return CoffeeRun[] A list of CoffeeRuns open for orders
     */
    public function openForOrders();

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="php">final class CoffeeRunsRepositoryInMemory implements CoffeeRunsRepository
{
    // ...

    public function openForOrders()
    {
        $coffeeRuns = $this-&gt;getAll();
        $openForOrders = array();

        foreach ($coffeeRuns as $coffeeRun) {
            if ($coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade()) {
                $openForOrders[] = $coffeeRun;
            }
        }

        return $openForOrders;
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is what's left in the controller after extraction:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders()
{
    return $this-&gt;coffeeRunsRepository-&gt;openForOrders();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't like the <code>Repository</code> word in there, while we're thinking about the Repository as just being a Collection. Let's rename the variable in our controller. Notice how well this reads:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders()
{
    return $this-&gt;coffeeruns-&gt;openForOrders();
}
</code></pre>

<p>"Return CoffeeRuns that are Open For Orders". I like it. What's even better, is that the filtering of the Collection is now happening in the object that worries about the Collection, namely the Repository. This means that the specific implementations can optimize for their own benifits. E.g. the database implementation of the Repository can use a specific <code>WHERE</code> query so that it doesn't need to filter <code>CoffeeRun</code>s in PHP, and as a result of that it doesn't need to load a whole list of <code>CoffeeRun</code> objects into memory.</p>

<h2 id="bump-your-head-twice">Bump your head twice</h2>

<p>What if we want a second method in our controller that displays all CoffeeRuns that are open for orders, and will happen before noon? The <code>openForOrders()</code> method won't be enough. We could use it, and then use a <code>foreach</code> as in the first example of the blog post, but then we're back to square one. We could also make it a Repository method, and that would be okay, but only if we don't have to do it too many times. Let's look for a different solution.</p>

<p>It looks like we now have two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>We want to encapsulate the "looping over a list and picking out specific items"</li>
<li>We want to combine several of these actions on a list, or at least do them in succession</li>
</ol>

<p>The problems always come up when we're talking to the Repository. We made two changes to it, that were both half solutions. The Repository has too many responsibilities (Storage and Collection). What would happen if we'd return an object representing a list of CoffeeRun objects from the Repository, and use that to iterate over? The Repository only takes care of the storage, and the Collection object takes care of the Collection stuff.</p>

<p>What we want to do is "filter" CoffeeRuns so that we get CoffeeRuns that are open for orders, and then filter those again so that we get those open for orders that are happening before noon. In pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code class="php">coffeeRuns = repository.getAll
coffeeRuns
    .thatAre(openForOrders)
    .thatAre(happeningBeforeNoon)
</code></pre>

<p>If we can express <code>openForOrders</code> and <code>happeningBeforeNoon</code> as functions that take a <code>CoffeeRun</code> object and return a boolean (we'll call them predicates), then the <code>thatAre()</code> implementation could be very generic! Let's check it out:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$openForOrders = function (CoffeeRun $coffeeRun)
{
    return $coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade();
};

$noon = new DateTime('today noon');
$happeningBeforeNoon = function (CoffeeRun $coffeeRun) use ($noon)
{
    return $coffeeRun-&gt;getDate() &lt; $noon;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now we'll create the <code>CoffeeRuns</code> Collection object, with a <code>thatAre</code> method:</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface CoffeeRuns
{
    /**
     * @param callable function that takes a CoffeeRun and returns a boolean
     *
     * @return CoffeeRuns that match the predicate
     */
    public function thatAre(callable $matchingPredicate);

    /**
     * @return CoffeeRun[] An array of CoffeeRuns
     */
    public function asArray();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's create a naÃ¯ve <code>array</code> based implementation of it:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class CoffeeRunsArray implements CoffeeRuns
{
    private $coffeeRuns;

    public function __construct(array $coffeeRuns)
    {
        $this-&gt;coffeeRuns = $coffeeRuns;
    }

    public function thatAre(callable $matchingPredicate)
    {
        return new static(
            array_filter(
                $this-&gt;coffeeRuns,
                $matchingPredicate
            )
        );
    }

    public function asArray()
    {
        $this-&gt;coffeeRuns;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Right now, we can have our <code>CoffeeRunsRepository</code> return a <code>CoffeeRuns</code> Collection object for the <code>getAll()</code> method instead of <code>CoffeeRun[]</code> (an array of CoffeeRun) objects, and remove the specific methods we created, like <code>openForOrders()</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface CoffeeRunsRepository
{
    /**
     * @return CoffeeRuns A collection of CoffeeRuns
     */
    public function getAll();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the controller, we now get this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class CoffeeController
{
    private $coffeeRuns;
    private $openForOrders;
    private $happeningBeforeNoon;

    public function __construct(CoffeeRunsRepository $repository)
    {
        $this-&gt;coffeeRuns = $repository;

        $this-&gt;openForOrders = function (CoffeeRun $coffeeRun)
        {
            return $coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade();
        };

        $noon = new DateTime('today noon');
        $this-&gt;happeningBeforeNoon = function (CoffeeRun $coffeeRun) use ($noon)
        {
            return $coffeeRun-&gt;getDate() &lt; $noon;
        };
    }

    public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrders()
    {
        $coffeeRuns =
            $this-&gt;coffeeRuns-&gt;getAll()
            -&gt;thatAre($this-&gt;openForOrders);

        return $coffeeRuns-&gt;asArray();
    }

    public function displayCoffeeRunsOpenForOrdersAndBeforeNoon()
    {
        $coffeeRuns =
            $this-&gt;coffeeRuns-&gt;getAll()
            -&gt;thatAre($this-&gt;openForOrders)
            -&gt;thatAre($this-&gt;happeningBeforeNoon);

        return $coffeeRuns-&gt;asArray();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the individual methods got very readable. The operations on the Collections are encapsulated. I extracted the <code>$openForOrders</code> and <code>$happeningBeforeNoon</code> predicates to class variables, because I didn't like the duplication in both controller methods, however, I'm not satisfied with their presence in the constructor. We could create a <code>Predicate</code> interface and make the <code>thatAre()</code> method accept <code>Predicate</code> instances. As a result our controller would just do something like <code>$coffeeRuns-&gt;thatAre(new OpenForOrders());</code>. But let's leave it like this for now. I've got some critical questions coming in:</p>

<h2 id="wait-a-minute%21-you-didn%27t-solve-the-memory-problem%21">Wait a minute! You didn't solve the memory problem!</h2>

<p>Exactly. Let's do that right now.</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class CoffeeRunsWithIterator implements CoffeeRuns
{
    private $coffeeRuns;
    private $predicates;

    public function __construct(Iterator $coffeeRuns, array $predicates = array())
    {
        $this-&gt;coffeeRuns = $coffeeRuns;
        $this-&gt;predicates = $predicates;
    }

    public function thatAre(callable $matchingPredicate)
    {
        $predicates = $this-&gt;predicates;
        $predicates[] = $matchingPredicate;

        return new static(
            $this-&gt;coffeeRuns,
            $predicates
        );
    }

    public function asArray()
    {
        $collectionAsArray = array();

        foreach ($this-&gt;coffeeRuns as $coffeeRun) {
            foreach ($this-&gt;predicates as $predicate) {
                if (call_user_func($predicate, $coffeeRun) !== true) {
                    continue 2;
                }
            }

            $collectionAsArray[] = $coffeeRun;
        }

        return $collectionAsArray;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is an implementation of the <code>CoffeeRuns</code> Collection interface that takes an <code>Iterator</code>. Whenever the <code>thatAre()</code> method gets called with a predicate, we don't do anything, except for creating a new instance of the Collection class with the same <code>Iterator</code> in it, but with the predicate added to the list of predicates that must be matched for each element in the Collection. It's only at the last step, when we try to extract the contents of the collection, that we run the <code>Iterator</code> and check every value against the given predicates. We still need to run the predicates against the whole collection, but because they are within an <code>Iterator</code>, the <code>Iterator</code> can e.g. get them from the database one by one. That's an implementation detail of the Repository.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-we-want-to-be-able-to-use-mysql-%60where%60-statements-in-our-repositories%3F">What if we want to be able to use MySQL <code>WHERE</code> statements in our Repositories?</h2>

<p>Let's say that we want to create a MySQL implementation of the Repository. We don't really want to write a query that will get the whole list of CoffeeRuns, even though we worked with an <code>Iterator</code> before (and thus preserving memory issues), so just passing closures to the <code>thatAre()</code> method will not help us a whole lot to write efficient queries. To improve on that, we could start passing our predicates as objects instead of closures, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface CoffeeRuns
{
    /**
     * @param Predicate that CoffeeRuns need to satisfy
     *
     * @return CoffeeRuns that match the predicate
     */
    public function thatAre(Predicate $matching);

    /**
     * @return CoffeeRun[] An array of CoffeeRuns
     */
    public function asArray();
}
</code></pre>

<p>A predicate could look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface Predicate
{
    /**
     * @param CoffeeRun the CoffeeRun we want to check
     *
     * @return bool if the Predicate is satisfied by given CoffeeRun
     */
    public function isSatisfiedBy(CoffeeRun $coffeeRun);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And to get the same functionality as before we can implement it like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class OpenForOrders implements Predicate
{
    public function isSatisfiedBy(CoffeeRun $coffeeRun)
    {
        return $coffeeRun-&gt;ordersCanBeMade();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When we have this in place, implementing a repository that can translate these predicates to the correct <code>WHERE</code> statements is pretty much trivial: without doing an actual query, the Repository returns a <code>CoffeeRuns</code> collection object that can be filtered using <code>Predicate</code>s and when that is done, the query can be built by translating the Predicates to the appropriate <code>WHERE</code> statements. Now the <code>Predicate</code> object can still be used to check if a given <code>CoffeeRun</code> satisfies the rule encapsulated within it, but within the Repository, a more efficient way is used against the whole database table full of CoffeeRuns. Eric Evans calls this concept <code>Specification</code>, and you can read all about it in his great book <a href="http://dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/">Domain Driven Design</a>.</p>

<h2 id="doing-something-with-all-objects-in-our-collection">Doing something with all objects in our collection</h2>

<p>Let's say we want people to <code>stopOrdering()</code> for all <code>CoffeeRun</code>s that are happening before noon.</p>

<pre><code class="php">$stopOrdering = function (CoffeeRun $coffeeRun)
{
    $coffeeRun-&gt;stopOrdering();

    return $coffeeRun;
};

$coffeeRuns = $repository-&gt;getAll();
$stoppedOrderingForTheseRuns = $coffeeRuns
    -&gt;thatAre($happeningBeforeNoon)
    -&gt;updateEach($stopOrdering);
</code></pre>

<p>Let's add it to the Collection interface:</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface CoffeeRuns
{
    /**
     * @param Predicate that CoffeeRuns need to satisfy
     *
     * @return CoffeeRuns that match the predicate
     */
    public function thatAre(Predicate $matching);

    /**
     * @param callable function that takes a CoffeeRun and returns an updated one
     *
     * @return CoffeeRuns that got updated
     */
    public function updateEach(callable $update);

    /**
     * @return CoffeeRun[] An array of CoffeeRuns
     */
    public function asArray();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The implementation for the <code>CoffeeRunsArray</code> could be something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class CoffeeRunsArray implements CoffeeRuns
{
    private $coffeeRuns;

    public function __construct(array $coffeeRuns)
    {
        $this-&gt;coffeeRuns = $coffeeRuns;
    }

    public function thatAre(Predicate $predicate)
    {
        return new static(
            array_filter(
                $this-&gt;coffeeRuns,
                function (CoffeeRun $run) use ($predicate) {
                    return $predicate-&gt;isSatisfiedBy($run);
                }
            )
        );
    }

    public function updateEach(callable $update)
    {
        return new static(
            array_map(
                $update,
                $this-&gt;coffeeRuns
            )
        );
    }

    public function asArray()
    {
        $this-&gt;coffeeRuns;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the implementation is trivial in this case, but again it provides us with a powerful abstraction. The code that operates on the Collection doesn't have to know anything about how the Collection is implemented, it just knows about the methods we provided for interacting with it. For those that are into functional programming, we just implemented <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code> here.</p>

<p>I hope you see the value in this. For pieces of code where a lot of actions need to happen on Collections of objects, this might be the way to go. Since the code doesn't have to know anything about the implementation of the Collection, you can change it at any time. For instance, when you start out, you can just use a simple <code>Array</code> implementation, and swap it out for an <code>Iterator</code> later on when you notice memory consumption going up. It can also make things pretty readable, as demonstrated above with the <code>$coffeeRuns-&gt;thatAre(new OpenForOrders());</code>.</p>

<p>You can also choose to go A LOT further, or less far into this, as you desire. Good luck on your explorations!</p>

<p>PS: I gave a talk on this subject at the <a href="http://php.gent/">PHP.GENT meetup</a>, you can find the slides <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/turanct/the-language-of-collections">here</a>.</p>

            <updated>2017-09-22T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2017/09/22/using-decorators-for-debugging</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you're writing SOLID code, you probably hide some implementation details behind interfaces in many parts of your codebase. In this post, we'll talk about an HTTP client, which is hidden behind an interface. The exact implementation we use doesn't matter. It could be a simple cURL call, or we could be using a more advance package like <a href="https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/">Guzzle</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kriswallsmith/Buzz">Buzz</a>. In any case, our application knows only about the <code>HttpClient</code> interface that it defined, like this.</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace CoffeeRun;

interface HttpClient
{
    /**
     * @param Request $request An HTTP Request
     *
     * @throws ClientException if the request failed
     *
     * @return Response a response instance
     */
    public function execute(Request $request): Response;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our code will ask the <code>HttpClient</code> implementation to <code>execute()</code> a <code>Request</code> and expects a <code>Response</code> if the call succeeded, or a <code>ClientException</code> if something unexpected happens.</p>

<p>The cool thing about this, is that our whole codebase needs to only know about this one interface, and not about the specific package that we're going to use. Plus, we can use another (fake) implementation of the <code>HttpClient</code> interface during testing.</p>

<h2 id="decorators">Decorators</h2>

<p>Now let's say that we want our application to make all HTTP calls with a certain User-Agent header. We don't want to go into our code and change every occurrence of <code>new Request</code> to also include that specific header. This is where decorators come in. We can "wrap" the <code>HttpClient</code> instance in a shell that acts as if it's the original <code>HttpClient</code>, but just takes the incoming <code>Request</code> and adds that header to it, and then passes on the call to the wrapped <code>HttpClient</code>. Like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace CoffeeRun;

final class ClientWithUserAgent implements HttpClient
{
    private $wrappedClient;
    private $userAgentString;

    public function __construct(HttpClient $wrappedClient, $userAgentString = 'Coffee Bot 1.0')
    {
        $this-&gt;wrappedClient = $wrappedClient;
        $this-&gt;userAgentString = (string) $userAgentString;
    }

    public function execute(Request $request): Response
    {
        $request = $request-&gt;withHeader('User-Agent', $this-&gt;userAgentString);

        return $this-&gt;wrappedClient-&gt;execute($request);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Creating an instance looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$httpClient = new ClientWithUserAgent(
    new ClientCurl(),
    'ROBOCOP'
);
</code></pre>

<p>As this Decorator also implements the same <code>HttpClient</code> interface, the application doesn't even know this is happening, because from the outside it looks and behaves exactly the same. This change essentially now is a change in the configuration file of our Dependency Injection Container, no other files needed to be changed to make this happen.</p>

<h2 id="using-decorators-for-investigation">Using decorators for investigation</h2>

<p>Now, if we want to investigate the requests and responses that we get from a service while the application is running, e.g. when an unidentified bug is happening, we could do it with a decorator. The rest of the application won't know about it and should just keep on working as usual, while we get logs of the data that we want:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace CoffeeRun;

final class LoggingClient implements HttpClient
{
    private $wrappedClient;
    private $logger;

    public function __construct(HttpClient $wrappedClient, LoggerInterface $logger)
    {
        $this-&gt;wrappedClient = $wrappedClient;
        $this-&gt;logger = $logger;
    }

    public function execute(Request $request): Response
    {
        $this-&gt;logger-&gt;debug('request', $request);

        $response = $this-&gt;wrappedClient-&gt;execute($request);

        $this-&gt;logger-&gt;debug('response', $response);

        return $response;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The request and response are logged in our logs now, and they look good to us, but we still haven't found what we're looking for and we want to see if the requests our app is making work from the command line using <code>curl</code>. What if we made our application also log the complete curl commands? Then we could just copy paste them in our terminal to test them locally.</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace CoffeeRun;

final class CurlCommandLoggingClient implements HttpClient
{
    private $wrappedClient;
    private $logger;

    public function __construct(HttpClient $wrappedClient, LoggerInterface $logger)
    {
        $this-&gt;wrappedClient = $wrappedClient;
        $this-&gt;logger = $logger;
    }

    public function execute(Request $request): Response
    {
        $method = $request-&gt;getMethod();
        $url = $request-&gt;getUrl();
        $params = $request-&gt;getParams();
        $headers = $request-&gt;getHeaders();

        $curlString = 'curl';
        $curlString .= ' --' . strtolower($method);

        foreach ($params as $key =&gt; $value) {
            $curlString .= ' --data "' . $key . '=' . $value . '"';
        }

        foreach ($headers as $key =&gt; $value) {
            $curlString .= ' --header "' . $key . '=' . $value . '"';
        }

        $curlString .= ' "' . $url . '"';

        $this-&gt;logger-&gt;debug('curl command', $curlString);

        return $this-&gt;client-&gt;execute($request);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this is an oversimplified way of building the <code>curl</code> command, but this will help you debug your HTTP calls by copy/pasting them to your terminal! Easy as that, and still no changes to the existing code. It takes one line to change it, and one line to delete and bring it back to production values.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>

<ul>
<li>Liskov Substition Principle: It's very important that our decorators still adhere to the original contract of the wrapped instance (in this case the <code>HttpClient</code> interface). If the decorator would produce another return value, or take different method parameters, it wouldn't work.</li>
<li>Applying a decorator that logs a lot of data in production might have an impact on your host. This is just an example of using your existing interfaces to create some plug &amp; play debugging solutions. If you do something like this in production, use the same caution as with other changes in production.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it! Have fun.</p>

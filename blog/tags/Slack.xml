            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At CX Social, we use emoji extensively. 💰💭 We believe they are an enrichment of ongoing conversations, and can be used to express things that can't be expressed in a textual representation. Let's see how and where we use them 👌</p>

<h2 id="slack">Slack</h2>

<p>Our main communication form is chat. We use Slack and we just love the integration of emoji in their application! They're everywhere! 😻</p>

<p>Also, the "reactions" are quite handy to not mess up conversation flow with emoji only.</p>

<p>In full conversation, it looks a bit like this:</p>

<h2 id="github">GitHub</h2>

<p>Of course, our conversations in Issues and Pull Requests on github resemble those on Slack...</p>

<p>And in our commits, we use the <a href="http://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/">gitmoji</a> way of prefixing commit messages with one or more semi-standardized emoji, to make it <strong>much clearer</strong> what the commit is about.</p>

<h2 id="emoji-news">Emoji-news</h2>

<p>To top it off, there's a dedicated channel on our company chat for <strong>emoji-only</strong> conversation. It's called <code>#emoji-news</code>.</p>

<p>The great thing about all this, is that emoji really have positive vibes about them, and they work in an inspiring, encouraging way in conversations. They make you laugh, or they express a feeling that could be very difficult to express in text only. They provide context to what was said. They can be combined to create whole stories in just a few images. They work cross-language. They can be abused. It's just fantastic 😏. We are so into it, that we added 100's of our own custom emoji to slack, which in turn add much more specific things that we could express (you can find some of them in the screenshots above). If you're looking for custom emoji, <a href="http://slackmojis.com">Slackmojis</a> is a great place to start looking.</p>

<p>Have a great day! ☕️</p>

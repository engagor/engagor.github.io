            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you're writing SOLID code, you probably hide some implementation details behind interfaces in many parts of your codebase. In this post, we'll talk about an HTTP client, which is hidden behind an interface. The exact implementation we use doesn't matter. It could be a simple cURL call, or we could be using a more advance package like <a href="https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/">Guzzle</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kriswallsmith/Buzz">Buzz</a>. In any case, our application knows only about the <code>HttpClient</code> interface that it defined, like this.</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace CoffeeRun;

interface HttpClient
{
    /**
     * @param Request $request An HTTP Request
     *
     * @throws ClientException if the request failed
     *
     * @return Response a response instance
     */
    public function execute(Request $request): Response;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our code will ask the <code>HttpClient</code> implementation to <code>execute()</code> a <code>Request</code> and expects a <code>Response</code> if the call succeeded, or a <code>ClientException</code> if something unexpected happens.</p>

<p>The cool thing about this, is that our whole codebase needs to only know about this one interface, and not about the specific package that we're going to use. Plus, we can use another (fake) implementation of the <code>HttpClient</code> interface during testing.</p>

<h2 id="decorators">Decorators</h2>

<p>Now let's say that we want our application to make all HTTP calls with a certain User-Agent header. We don't want to go into our code and change every occurrence of <code>new Request</code> to also include that specific header. This is where decorators come in. We can "wrap" the <code>HttpClient</code> instance in a shell that acts as if it's the original <code>HttpClient</code>, but just takes the incoming <code>Request</code> and adds that header to it, and then passes on the call to the wrapped <code>HttpClient</code>. Like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace CoffeeRun;

final class ClientWithUserAgent implements HttpClient
{
    private $wrappedClient;
    private $userAgentString;

    public function __construct(HttpClient $wrappedClient, $userAgentString = 'Coffee Bot 1.0')
    {
        $this-&gt;wrappedClient = $wrappedClient;
        $this-&gt;userAgentString = (string) $userAgentString;
    }

    public function execute(Request $request): Response
    {
        $request = $request-&gt;withHeader('User-Agent', $this-&gt;userAgentString);

        return $this-&gt;wrappedClient-&gt;execute($request);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Creating an instance looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$httpClient = new ClientWithUserAgent(
    new ClientCurl(),
    'ROBOCOP'
);
</code></pre>

<p>As this Decorator also implements the same <code>HttpClient</code> interface, the application doesn't even know this is happening, because from the outside it looks and behaves exactly the same. This change essentially now is a change in the configuration file of our Dependency Injection Container, no other files needed to be changed to make this happen.</p>

<h2 id="using-decorators-for-investigation">Using decorators for investigation</h2>

<p>Now, if we want to investigate the requests and responses that we get from a service while the application is running, e.g. when an unidentified bug is happening, we could do it with a decorator. The rest of the application won't know about it and should just keep on working as usual, while we get logs of the data that we want:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace CoffeeRun;

final class LoggingClient implements HttpClient
{
    private $wrappedClient;
    private $logger;

    public function __construct(HttpClient $wrappedClient, LoggerInterface $logger)
    {
        $this-&gt;wrappedClient = $wrappedClient;
        $this-&gt;logger = $logger;
    }

    public function execute(Request $request): Response
    {
        $this-&gt;logger-&gt;debug('request', $request);

        $response = $this-&gt;wrappedClient-&gt;execute($request);

        $this-&gt;logger-&gt;debug('response', $response);

        return $response;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The request and response are logged in our logs now, and they look good to us, but we still haven't found what we're looking for and we want to see if the requests our app is making work from the command line using <code>curl</code>. What if we made our application also log the complete curl commands? Then we could just copy paste them in our terminal to test them locally.</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace CoffeeRun;

final class CurlCommandLoggingClient implements HttpClient
{
    private $wrappedClient;
    private $logger;

    public function __construct(HttpClient $wrappedClient, LoggerInterface $logger)
    {
        $this-&gt;wrappedClient = $wrappedClient;
        $this-&gt;logger = $logger;
    }

    public function execute(Request $request): Response
    {
        $method = $request-&gt;getMethod();
        $url = $request-&gt;getUrl();
        $params = $request-&gt;getParams();
        $headers = $request-&gt;getHeaders();

        $curlString = 'curl';
        $curlString .= ' --' . strtolower($method);

        foreach ($params as $key =&gt; $value) {
            $curlString .= ' --data "' . $key . '=' . $value . '"';
        }

        foreach ($headers as $key =&gt; $value) {
            $curlString .= ' --header "' . $key . '=' . $value . '"';
        }

        $curlString .= ' "' . $url . '"';

        $this-&gt;logger-&gt;debug('curl command', $curlString);

        return $this-&gt;client-&gt;execute($request);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this is an oversimplified way of building the <code>curl</code> command, but this will help you debug your HTTP calls by copy/pasting them to your terminal! Easy as that, and still no changes to the existing code. It takes one line to change it, and one line to delete and bring it back to production values.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>

<ul>
<li>Liskov Substition Principle: It's very important that our decorators still adhere to the original contract of the wrapped instance (in this case the <code>HttpClient</code> interface). If the decorator would produce another return value, or take different method parameters, it wouldn't work.</li>
<li>Applying a decorator that logs a lot of data in production might have an impact on your host. This is just an example of using your existing interfaces to create some plug &amp; play debugging solutions. If you do something like this in production, use the same caution as with other changes in production.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it! Have fun.</p>

            <link href="/blog/2017/09/01/star-vars"/>
            <updated>2017-09-01T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2017/09/01/star-vars</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, we'll look at a type of variables that I call Star Vars, they're stars and shouldn't be touched. In any case. Whatsoever. Just don't start editing these in your code, or you'll eventually break stuff, with 100% guarantee.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-i%3A-the-timestamp-menace">Star Vars I: The Timestamp Menace</h2>

<p>Timestamps are nice: asking the Unix Epoch timestamp results in a number that's the same, independent of in which timezone you are. The secret to this, is that a moment in history was labeled as Unix Epoch, and the timestamp is just the number of seconds that has passed from that moment up until now.</p>

<p>And that's where things start to get nasty: with the understanding of what the number means (the number of seconds passed since January 1st 1970), people start editing the number to get dates in the past or future. What they're almost never take in consideration is the fact that time isn't linear, dates aren't the same around the globe, there are leap seconds, leap years, etc. There are too many exceptions from the rule, to just start adding <code>60 * 60 * 24</code> seconds to a timestamp's value, to get the next day. Don't do it. Your language most probably has a <code>DateTime</code> package to do just that, with less mistakes.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-ii%3A-attack-of-the-%60%24_post%60">Star Vars II: Attack Of The <code>$_POST</code></h2>

<p>When a HTTP request is made to your app, there are most likely <code>POST</code> or <code>GET</code> parameters being passed along. In PHP, and likely other languages, these are made available trough (global) variables, no different than other variables. Thus, they can be changed, or used in computations or output. Be very careful with that!</p>

<p>Changing a global variable means that it will be changed everywhere, so you risk breaking functionality in other places when you change e.g. the <code>$_POST</code> variable. Optimally, you could reduce the risk by using the immutable datastructures that your PSR-7 framework makes available to you.</p>

<p>Also, using user input in calculations and/or output might result in errors or major hacks of your software. Be very cautious! People might be able to steal your app's data, run arbitrary code on your server, or impersonate users.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-iii%3A-events-of-the-sith">Star Vars III: Events Of The Sith</h2>

<p>Since forever now, people use event dispatching and event sourcing as a way to let systems know about state changes, or even build their state from scratch based on events only. These <em>events</em> are nothing more than a "record" of something that has happened (in the past complete sense). Something that has happened will never change anymore, so the variables holding events should never be changed. Events are <em>immutable</em>. If you do change them, you change history, which I assume you aren't enabled to do.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-iv%3A-a-new-%60%24row%60">Star Vars IV: A New <code>$row</code></h2>

<p>Here's the classic "naming things" exercise. We all know it's hard, but it's also very important. Take your time, give variables an appropriate name. I'm not touching your <code>$row</code> because I don't know what it is.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-v%3A-the-query-strikes-back">Star Vars V: The Query Strikes Back</h2>

<p>Whether you're using an ORM or not, you might write the occasional database query from time to time. I find myself still writing my own queries for the sake of simplicity, inside the database specific implementation of e.g. a repository. Sometimes, for instance when you need "filter" functionality over a huge number of entities based on their various properties, it's tempting to write a query in a very generic way so that reusable parts of the query get concatenated into one final query. I find this a very dangerous practice, all the while not providing much benefit over writing the same query a few times with minor changes. Since the repository implementation we're doing this in is the only place in our codebase that knows about the database, we shouldn't care too much about duplication here.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-vi%3A-return-of-the-id">Star Vars VI: Return Of The ID</h2>

<p>Making assumptions about the form of variables can be quite dangerous. Let's say that you expect a string to be in place, but what you get is an empty string. Is that valid? Now, think of identifiers of different objects. Sometimes, people use incremental numeric values (more often than not generated by the database) as identifiers for their objects, e.g. the <code>Person</code> with id <code>1337</code> is a cool guy. Already I can think of multiple cases of unexpected values for numerical ids, like <code>0</code>, <code>-1</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>''</code>, <code>foo</code>... If we then make the assumption that we'll save them as an integer in the database, we'll shoot ourselves in the foot by saving an object with id <code>'arrow'</code> or <code>'knee'</code>. Or what if the id is a numerical value that is too big to fit inside an integer?</p>

<p>How about string representations, do you ask? For instance, post ids on the Facebook API have ids in the form of <code>{page id}_{post id}</code>. Now that you know this, given a post with an id, could you tell me the page id? Yes, but... what if Facebook decides to change their <em>naming scheme</em> for new posts (which they actually do from time to time)? From now on posts are called <code>pid_{random number}</code>. Now if we had logic in our software that depended on the implicit knowledge of the id was being made of two parts, it will break for those new posts.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is: ids are black boxes, they could contain anything, and we shouldn't make assumptions about them, break them up into meaningful parts, or save them as anything else than strings inside the database.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-vii%3A-the-%60git-push---force%60-awakens">Star Vars VII: The <code>git push --force</code> Awakens</h2>

<p>Even though <code>git</code> isn't a variable in the context of this blog post, I wanted to put this one in: <code>git push --force</code> is evil. The only reason why you would want to do this, is to change <em>public history</em>, which is something that can't be done. For more about that, scroll up to the Star Vars III section, or read <a href="/blog/2017/01/24/some-tips-for-a-better-git-history/">this blog post about git</a>.</p>

<h2 id="star-vars-viii%3A-the-last-url">Star Vars VIII: The Last URL</h2>

<p>The last, but not least, "star var" is the URL. Now, we all know and understand the most basic building blocks of URLs, like the scheme, tld, and query. But actually, the standard for URLs is quite complicated, and there could be many moving parts. People don't always include the scheme (e.g. the <code>https://</code> part), or the TLD is longer than 3 characters. Therefor, parsing an URL, or changing anything meaningful of it could be very error-prone. Have a look at <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/07/improved_regex_for_matching_urls">this regular expression to parse an URL</a>. As you can see, it's not as simple as you think. In fact, most languages have <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.php">built-in functionality</a> for this, as well as <a href="http://uri.thephpleague.com/">great packages</a>. As a side-note, the same goes for e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and many other things.</p>

<p>That's it for now! Keep in mind that a lot of these problems can be solved by either using established packages, built-in language features, or <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value Objects</a> (or a mixture of several of those). May the force be with you!</p>

            <link href="/blog/2017/08/21/simple-rules-for-simpler-code"/>
            <updated>2017-08-21T11:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2017/08/21/simple-rules-for-simpler-code</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We as developers care about simple code. Simple code makes it easier to read and debug code which will allow you to build new features and fix bugs faster.</p>

<p>In this blogpost I would like to explain a few simple rules to get simpler code. The code examples will be written in PHP and are therefore more suited to procedural programming languages.</p>

<h2 id="1.-avoid-else">1. Avoid else</h2>

<p>This is probably my favourite rule. Avoiding else can drastically improve the readability of your code. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="php">if ($isAllowedToReadAutomationRecipes) {
  $automationRecipes = $this-&gt;repository-&gt;getByAccountId($accountId);
} else {
  $automationRecipes = [];
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can almost always simplify this to:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$automationRecipes = [];
if ($isAllowedToReadAutomationRecipes) {
  $automationRecipes = $this-&gt;repository-&gt;getByAccountId($accountId);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Look ma, no else!</p>

<h2 id="2.-use-early-returns">2. Use early returns</h2>

<p>Early returns are a nice way to simplify code. Using early returns goes hand in hand with avoiding else. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="php">class PostController
{
    public function delete()
    {
        $post = $this-&gt;repository-&gt;getById($postId);
        if ($post) {
            if ($isConfirmed) {
                $user-&gt;deletePost($post);
                $success = $this-&gt;repository-&gt;persist($post);
                if ($success) {
                    return $this-&gt;success('The post was successfully deleted');
                } else {
                    return $this-&gt;error('Something went wrong.');
                }
            } else {
                return $this-&gt;confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this post?');
            }
        } else {
            return $this-&gt;error('The post was not found.');
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's really hard to see the flow of the code, don't you think? Let's refactor the example to use early returns:</p>

<pre><code class="php">class PostController
{
    public function delete()
    {
        $post = $this-&gt;repository-&gt;getById($postId);
        if ($post === null) {
            return $this-&gt;error('The post was not found.');
        }
        if ($isConfirmed === false) {
            return $this-&gt;confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this post?');
        }

        $user-&gt;deletePost($post);
        $success = $this-&gt;repository-&gt;persist($post);
        if ($success === false) {
            return $this-&gt;error('Something went wrong. Try again.');
        }

        return $this-&gt;success('The post was successfully deleted');
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What do you prefer? I surely prefer the latter. Early returns keep the level of indentation low and make the happy path of the code visible.</p>

<h2 id="3.-use-meaningful-variables-names">3. Use meaningful variables names</h2>

<p>If you abbreviate the names of variables you probably don't have a good IDE (autocompletion). It might make sense to use abbreviations while writing some quick code but it will eventually shoot you in the back when you need to fix a bug. You'll lose valuable time by deciphering the code.</p>

<h2 id="4.-avoid-code-comments">4. Avoid code comments</h2>

<p>Each time you're commenting code you're failing to express yourself. This rule goes hand in hand with meaningful variable names. Code comments can get outdated and nothing is as damaging as lies and misinformation. The code is the only source of truth. If you find yourself writing a code comment think of ways to make it clear in the code by extracting variables and functions with meaningful names. Sometimes a well placed comment can be helpful. They'll likely explain the why while the code explains the what/how.</p>

<h2 id="5.-follow-a-consistent-coding-standard">5. Follow a consistent coding standard</h2>

<p>Following a consistent coding standard makes sure all code is formatted in the same way. Which makes it easier to read code because you expect it to be formatted in a specific way. For PHP this is <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/">PSR-2</a>. I don't like every rule in <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/">PSR-2</a> but it doesn't matter as long as everyone writes the same code. Please don't invent your own coding standard. It's a good practice to <a href="http://cs.sensiolabs.org/">lint and fix</a> coding style automatically.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope these simple rules will inspire you to leave the campground cleaner than you found it. Which rules do you think are important? Leave a comment (on disqus they are allowed)! If you want to know more, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a> is good read.</p>

<p>"Avoiding else" is a rule from <a href="https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/luontola/tdd-2009/ext/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf">Object Calisthenics</a>. If you want to become a better developer, read it.</p>

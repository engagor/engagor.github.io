            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a team, we consume A LOT of blog posts, YouTube videos, podcasts, and tweets about software development and related topics each year. We asked everyone in the team to share their favorite stuff that they found online, so that you can read it too. Here we go!</p>

<h3 id="in-the-kingdom-of-the-blind"><a href="https://bridgetkromhout.com/blog/in-the-kingdom-of-the-blind/">In The Kingdom Of The Blind</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you can imagine, there are plenty of reasons that under-represented people in tech aren't going to jump the second your event's CFP opens. But submissions will pour in nonetheless... from the folks whose (devrel/marketing/field engineer) vendor job includes public speaking (and on-the-job time to fine-tune their abstracts). And spoiler alert, many of them will fall into the majority cis het white male demographic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ursula recommends this for the great ideas on how to improve diversity at conferences, and an excellent candid overview of the reasons why underrepresented minorities do not speak at or attend tech conferences as often.</p>

<h3 id="we-fired-our-top-talent.-best-decision-we-ever-made."><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-fired-our-top-talent-best-decision-we-ever-made-4c0a99728fde">We fired our top talent. Best decision we ever made.</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your team's strength is not a function of the talent of individual members. It's a function of their collaboration, tenacity, and mutual respect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hans likes this because when there's a smart guy around, you'll find it tempting to just go ask him instead of trying to do the research yourself and learn something new. He doesn't like developers who think that they know everything. They don't. In fact, you'll never know everything. Sharing knowledge and working together as a team is something we should focus on instead. Each person has their own strengths.</p>

<h3 id="the-myth-of-the-%22cool-tech-girl%22"><a href="https://code.likeagirl.io/the-myth-of-the-cool-tech-girl-7868fa63769b">The myth of the "cool tech girl"</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't reward good behaviour with scotch, don't tap kegs at 12pm, and don't host video game or ping pong tournaments. Don't call your employees "rockstars". Shine a harsh light on some of your internal slack channels. If your company doesn't perpetuate the kind of culture that makes women feel like they need to be 'one of the boys', they won't need the coping mechanism of the "cool tech girl".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ursula has seen this type of behaviour from women in tech in many countries. "I would almost go as far as to say that if you don't fit into the 'cool tech girl' box, it's difficult to survive. As a woman in tech I think you have a responsibility to speak up for diversity in the industry. It's really hard, and it's great to hear viewpoints that identify that."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Event Storming is my pizza, you can add your toppings, as long as it's not database tables or pineapple</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Toon recommends this because Alberto Brandolini is a great speaker, and his vision on Domain Driven Design and software development in general is really clear and deep. He goes a long way to understand the business, and the problems associated with the business. He goes out of his way to find out how he can solve them.</p>

<h3 id="modern-software-over-engineering-mistakes"><a href="https://medium.com/@rdsubhas/10-modern-software-engineering-mistakes-bc67fbef4fc8">Modern Software Over-Engineering Mistakes</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Duplication is better than the wrong abstraction</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jurriaan likes this because too much of technical literature is about how you should start doing things, and how everything you’ve done in the past is probably wrong. This article captures the essence of trying to architect real-life development projects.</p>

<h3 id="kubernetes-at-github"><a href="https://githubengineering.com/kubernetes-at-github/">Kubernetes at Github</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a self-service application provisioning workflow in place, SRE can devote more of our time to delivering infrastructure products to the rest of the engineering organisation in support of our best practices, building toward a faster and more resilient GitHub experience for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeffry liked this because everybody and their dog are rethinking how to do platform now that the technology to do so has matured. This write-up from Github offers a great look into the decision making and preparation that goes into gradually building up confidence. He gives the author additional points for sprinkling snippets of inspiration throughout the post: e.g. chatops-rpc to make our hubot do more than offer drunk commentary, Kelsey Hightower's "Kubernetes the hard way" which he has set his mind to working through over the holidays, flipper and mission control bar and simulating kernel panics with sysrq-trigger.</p>

<h1 id="think-differently">Think Differently</h1>

<h3 id="exploring-time"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm95cYAtAa8">Exploring Time</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s impossible to know if this talk started on time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Toon recommends this because Eric Evans uses his own Domain Driven Design to explore better ways to think about time. Very inspiring. He shows how "generic" subdomains of software development are not generally "solved problems", and how you can make a difference there, as a programmer.</p>

<h3 id="clojure-for-the-brave-and-true"><a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/">Clojure for the Brave and True</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Humor has a certain relationship to seriousness. It is appropriate to joke about serious things, but only after the right amount of time has passed. For example, it took years for me to be able to crack a smile when I remember my favorite uncle’s last words: "Hold my beer".</p>
  
  <p>I'm so proud of you, little teapot. You've run your first Clojure program! Not only that, but you've become acquainted with the REPL, one of the most important tools for developing Clojure software. Amazing!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Niek thinks this book is a hilarious and down-to-earth explanation of yet another programming language to learn. Clojure is a Lisp dialect and will melt your brain with its elegance!</p>

<h3 id="you-suck-at-excel"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nbkaYsR94c">You Suck At Excel</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This material is -I guess- kinda like basic to intermediate, but for you all it's going to be stupid hard, so try paying attention and don't slow me down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Toon enjoyed this because this guy solves real world problems for people using Excel. "I learned a 100 things from seeing him work like this." He knows Excel inside out.</p>

<h3 id="lemme-tell-you-about-the-most-successful-program-i-ever-wrote"><a href="https://twitter.com/revin/status/940700486117634050">Lemme tell you about the most successful program I ever wrote</a></h3>

<h6 id="twitter-thread">(twitter thread)</h6>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was the first time I genuinely understood that users don't care how something is implemented; they care how it makes them feel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hans thinks we put so much effort in making our application code clean and future-proof while just a tiny poorly written program (that works) can make someone really happy. Software can seem magical for some people.</p>

<h1 id="big-data">Big Data</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Zo'n bracelet (gelinkt aan je identiteitsbewijs trouwens) is dus een mes dat aan twee kanten snijdt: handig, maar misschien ook de reden waarom u de volgende keer net iets minder "gewenst" bent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jasper likes this because it's incredible how much data a festival organizer track and save about you with just a bracelet, and also, what they (can possibly) do with it.</p>

  <p>Generative models are an active area of research, but we’re not quite there yet. If you want to build a conversational agent today your best bet is most likely a retrieval-based model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Niek checked this out because it was exactly the right content for his reply suggestions adventure, a feature he is working on for CX Social.</p>

<p>Those were our highlights for 2017, let us know if we missed something!</p>

            <updated>2017-09-27T11:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/2017/09/27/internship-webhooks-api</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you a student looking for an internship for Spring 2018? We have a project involving real-time API's and webhooks that you might find interesting. Read on to know what we do here at CX Social and what the project is about.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-do%3F">What do we do?</h2>

<p>The Clarabridge CX Social team builds a customer care tool for social media. Our clients use our software to be able to respond to the incoming questions and complaints on their Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, Instagram profiles, a.o. These clients often have a high volume of messages, on several social profiles. We try to make those people’s lives easier by offering automation tools, smart routing of messages and reply suggestions, among others.
<a href="https://developers.engagor.com/team">Read more about what we do</a>.</p>

<p>As of February 2018, we have room for one or more enthusiastic interns to join us for (at least) a couple of weeks <em>(preferably 4 days a week, any time between February 2017 to June 2018)</em>, to work as part of the CX Social development team.
As an intern you are an integral part of the R&amp;D team working on different parts of the application using technologies like PHP, React, MySQL, Redis, memcached, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ, a.o. The team consists of a designer, front-end developer, data scientist, and several system engineers &amp; full-stack web developers.
We are looking for a student with interest and knowledge of mainly back-end technologies, and some front-end knowledge.</p>

<p>Want to know more about what it’s like to do an internship here? Read about <a href="https://engagor.github.io/blog/2017/06/01/internship-gheerwijn-cx-social-developer/">Gheerwijn’s experiences</a> or the <a href="https://engagor.github.io/blog/2017/06/30/internship-achievements/">Achievements project intern Cedric is currently working on</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-project%3A-webhooks-api">The Project: Webhooks API</h2>

<p>CX Social has an Rest (oAuth JSON) API used by several of our clients. Its documentation is publicly available on our <a href="https://developers.engagor.com">developer site</a> so have a look to see what’s possible with it.<br />
Its uses include displaying important social profile metrics on own websites, two-way syncing of data from the CX Social CRM to other (in-house or 3rd party) CRM’s (like Salesforce, a.o.). It’s also being used to display curated social mentions on own sites, or to combine data from CX Social with data from other tools on internal dashboards.</p>

<p>Today, the API is used in a <code>PULL</code> model only, where clients (periodically) request information from our API. This internship project involves a significant update to allow <code>PUSH</code> webhooks to be send to our clients.<br />
Clients have been requesting this feature, and are eager to start using it, to be notified of new data (e.g. new tweets), or updates to data (e.g. when a certain social contact’s information is filled in) in real-time.
The project would take inspiration from the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks">Facebook Webhooks API</a>, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/webhooks">Twitter Webhooks API</a>, or <a href="https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/outgoing-webhooks">Slack’s Outgoing Webhooks API</a> and take into account other <a href="https://restful.io/webhooks-dos-and-dont-s-what-we-learned-after-integrating-100-apis-d567405a3671">common do's and don'ts regarding webhooks</a>.</p>

<p>It consists of the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating &amp; updating webhook-subscriptions (defining which webhooks should be delivered where). 

<ul>
<li>This should be possible via an API, as well as a web-interface;</li>
<li>Configured delivery URL’s should be checked for ownership by verification with configured handshake;</li>
<li>Configured delivery URL’s should be checked for validity of their SSL certificates;</li>
<li>Several types of subscriptions will be needed (i.e. subscribing to “account” updates, and subscribing to “user” updates);</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A robust webhook delivery system, consisting of:

<ul>
<li>Re-delivery when the delivery URL’s is unresponsive;</li>
<li>Trying to guarantee exactly-once delivery;</li>
<li>Signed webhook payloads, so receivers can verify the origin of the request;</li>
<li>Notifying the API user via email when their delivery URL continues to be unresponsive;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implementing the event-log that eventually triggers the webhooks:

<ul>
<li>Making sure changes in the CX Social code base trigger an event to the webhooks system;</li>
<li>Distribution of events to the right subscriptions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Monitoring of the system to:

<ul>
<li>Be alerted when webhook delivery is running behind.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</center></p>

<p>Together with the CX Social development team, you as an intern are responsible for choosing the right technologies &amp; architecture. For those interested in backend technologies, this will be an exciting project, that you can help shape, build and deploy to production.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This February, Gheerwijn joined the CX Social development team as an intern. Now, three months later, with the bulk of his internship over, we’ve asked him what that was like and what he built.</p>

<h3 id="building-a-social-profile-manager">Building a Social Profile Manager</h3>

<p>The idea for the subject of the internship started a few years ago when several of our customers, including the <a href="https://twitter.com/nmbs">Belgian Railways NMBS</a>, started showing off their Twitter reply times in their cover photo. NMBS took the reply time for their Twitter profile from the CX Social API and wrote the necessary code to showcase that on their page.</p>

<p><center>
<img src="/images/2017-06-01-profile-manager-internship-gheerwijn/nmbs.png" alt="NMBS Twitter Profile" /><br />
<small>NMBS Twitter Profile</small>
</center></p>

<p>We thought it would be great to build this into CX Social itself and improve on the idea with the extra features our tool offers, like having different cover images depending on your business hours, or showing different avatars depending on if a certain crisis plan is active. 
Gheerwijn, a student of <a href="https://www.odisee.be/nl/elektronica-ict">Electronica - ICT at Odisee Gent</a>, took on this challenge and dove right in.</p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn</strong>: <em>"The main purpose of the Profile Manager is to give CX Social customers a single place to manage all of their owned social profiles. Not only can it manage basic profile information, but it can also perform more complex tasks. The most striking feature of the Profile Manager is the ability to create themes. These themes are a combination of a profile photo and cover photo."</em></p>

<p>The idea was to offer clients the possibility to upload their own pictures and even annotate them. These annotations include plain text, but also variables like "reply time" or "unique users serviced".</p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"After a theme has been created, it can be scheduled for one or more profiles. This means that CX Social users can choose when a specific theme, like a Christmas theme, should be shown on certain profiles. We've also added the option to show different themes during/outside configured business hours schedules."</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>"This feature gives companies with a large customer base on social the ability to be transparant on how long it will approximately take to get an answer to their questions."</em></strong> - Gheerwijn</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="using-react-and-node.js">Using React and Node.js</h3>

<p>When asked about what were some of the most interesting aspects of the project, Gheerwijn cites the JavaScript library React and the backend technology Node.js as two fun technologies to work with.</p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"I had heard of React but never actually used it. A first experiment I did with it was a component to handle the scheduling of a theme. It proved to be an excellent way to quickly create interactive user interfaces, so I started to use it for everything I possibly could."</em></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"I also got to work on a Node.js microservice. Although I had already worked with Node.js on several occasions, I got to use new modules and libraries, like Fabric, which made it an interesting learning opportunity. I love how Node.js brings the joy of writing JavaScript to the backend.
The hardest part to get right was having the annoted images render correctly, both on the front-end as well as in the back-end."</em></p>

</center></p>

<p><strong>CX Social: Did you acquire any non-technical skills while working here?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn</strong>: <em>"Preparing for the weekly status meetings was a great way to learn how to separate the important things from the less important ones. It forced me to spend more time thinking about how the users would eventually use this feature. I learned that things that are obvious to the programmer aren't necessarily clear to the users."</em></p>

<h3 id="a-look-behind-the-scenes">A Look Behind the Scenes</h3>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"What drew me to this internship proposal was the fact that it involved social media. Everyone and their mother has a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram account. Not only individuals, but also companies are using social media on a daily basis. In this day and age, social media is something irreplaceable.
I started at CX Social because I wanted a look behind the scenes."</em></p>

<p><strong>CX Social:</strong> <strong>Did you have any idea what to expect that first day you started?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>I actually expected it to be quite stressful, mainly because it was such a big project to complete, but also because you suddenly start working in a company and you have to get to know everything and everyone.</em></p>

<p><strong>CX Social:</strong> <strong>So, how high were the stress levels then?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"Well, the team was very helpful. I felt like a real part of the team and not just ‘the intern’.
Anthony helped me out with getting to know the do's and don'ts in the codebase. Hans introduced me to several best practices and ways to make my code better. Down the road, I got to work with Jared and Ursula, who both took care of the design. Jurriaan was always able to come up with a solution to problems I would've never been able to fix on my own. And Toon showed me how to integrate my features in the task-scheduling back-end of CX Social. In the end, I got to work with everyone from the development team. I learned a lot just from asking other people how they would approach a certain problem."</em></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"When I thought something didn't make sense the way it was expected to be implemented, my thoughts about what I thought should change were actually taken into account and implemented."</em></p>

<p><strong>CX Social: Any moments during your internship that stood out?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gheerwijn:</strong> <em>"There are two moments I won't forget. The team went on a two-day off-site bootcamp. It was the perfect way to get to know all the team members. After an entire day of working, the evenings were filled with fun activities. It was certainly not something I was expecting to do during my internship!
The second unforgettable moment was the last day of my internship. After months of working on this one feature, the time had come to deploy it to production. We spent the last days pair programming the last bits to be able to put it live for testing. It was great seeing the work I did go live to beta-testers."</em></p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, we went on a two-day off-site with the CX Social development team for an event we dubbed "improvement bootcamp". It's the second time we did something like this and since it was fun and we got quite a lot of stuff done, we wanted to share our story. Maybe it could work for your team as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-roadmaps">The problem with roadmaps</h2>

<p>The idea behind a bootcamp is "drop everything, let's work on something else, someplace else for a few days". For two days, we were hidden away in a beautiful house in the fields of Waasland where we focused solely on what we like to call "little big details".</p>

<p>Over the course of the 6+ years that our product has existed, we have built up a huge database of customer requests. Prioritization and implementation of those requests is a constant process; in fact, almost all of our roadmap is compromised of client-requested features. We take logging these requests very seriously. Feature requests come to us through our ideas forum (where clients can post &amp; up-vote ideas), via our Live Chat, and via our dedicated Customer Success team. All of this information (what is requested, who is requesting it, if it's technically possible/feasible, etc.) is then ranked by priority and, after being curated by the Product Team, makes up the roadmap.</p>

<p>That roadmap becomes our daily job, at least when we're not playing <a href="https://engagor.github.io/blog/2017/03/01/batman-chatman/">Batman</a>. We always have a detailed roadmap for the next release of our product (around three months), and a more general one for the upcoming 12 months. This balance works for us; we can commit certain projects to our customers, while on the longer term we can stay flexible, react quickly to changing customer demands, and implement new social functionality when it becomes available.</p>

<small>When we try to do all at once</small>
</center></p>

<p>But, as it often goes, projects aren't perfectly defined from the start (their scope often grows) and we developers tend to underestimate projects, so getting everything finished on-time sometimes (more often than we’d like) results in neglecting some of the details. Those are the details that make a product stress-free, or - why not - even fun to use.</p>

<p>The "improvement bootcamp" is our initiative to force ourselves to periodically step back and focus on these little big details.</p>

<h2 id="little-big-details">Little Big Details</h2>

<p>But what do we mean with “little big details”? It can be anything from natural sorting of elements in tables, consistent design of similar pages throughout the application, to friendlier wording of messages in the application.</p>

<p>Often, they're simple things. Often, they're not real “new” features. Often, you might not even know you were missing them.</p>

<p>Have you noticed how, when using Google Maps to get directions to another place, the walking man icon changes into a person with a backpack and walking sticks? Or how Spotify congratulates you on your good taste in music when you click 'Lyrics' on a song that Spotify doesn't have lyrics for?</p>

<p>It's stuff like this that makes good products even more enjoyable to use.</p>

<p>For our tool, a few of the candidates we selected for the bootcamp include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A more consistent loading/empty view of widgets around the different dashboards that CX Social offers;</li>
<li>Requiring people to type the name of the topic they want to delete;</li>
<li>Remembering the text you typed in the reply bar, so that if it fails, users can easily try again;</li>
<li>Make the "click area" of widgets bigger when selecting widgets to add to a dashboard;</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these features will win awards, nor will they ever be on the top of most requested features lists; sometimes they're just small nuisances. But they do have an impact; it's details that make the difference between a good software product and one that's actually fun to use.</p>

<h2 id="the-action-plan">The action plan</h2>

<p><center><img src="/images/2017-05-22-march-2017-bootcamp/action-plan.png" alt="Spreadsheet with the action plan" /><br />
<small>Spreadsheet with the action plan</small></center></p>

<p>This was our action plan to get as much of this done, in a short timeframe, and have some fun while doing it:</p>

<ol>
<li>To start, we asked all members of the CX Social team, from Sales to Marketing, to tag improvements in our Github repository that they thought would fit the goal.</li>
<li>These were scored on a few aspects:

<ol>
<li>Priority: Indicator of how aligned the idea is with our product vision.</li>
<li>Impact: How many customers are requesting it or would benefit from it?</li>
<li>Workload: How long would it take us to implement this? (If it's expected to take longer than 4 hours, it's probably not a good candidate.)</li>
<li>Coolness: Sometimes the really fun ideas need a little bump, don't they?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The candidates were sorted according to the formula <code>(Impact * 1.5) + (Priority * 5) + (Workload * -2) + Coolness</code>. This would be the order in which we would tackle them.</li>
<li>The top 50 items in this priority list were discussed with everyone in the development team and assigned.</li>
<li>We started working on them on Wednesday morning with the goal of finishing work by Thursday evening.</li>
<li>During the coding, we kept track of our own and each other’s progress on a Github project board; indicating whenever a certain improvement was implemented, ready for review, reviewed, and ready for production.</li>
<li>On Thursday evening, we presented internally to the development team what everyone was able to accomplish.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-results">The results</h2>

<p>On Friday afternoon - our weekly beer-o'clock in the Gent office - we presented the results of the bootcamp to the whole CX Social team. In total, we were able to get 42 things done. The list included a bunch of internal improvements - thus making our support ninjas happy - and it included some longstanding customer requests.</p>

<small>Slide from the presentation to the team</small></center></p>

<p>It did take a few more days to put everything from the bootcamp into production, because we still had to hand it over to QA, prepare any customer communication, and make sure the merges happened in a coordinated way.</p>

<p>If you would argue that details and fun stuff like this should be part of the standard product and development workflow, I totally agree. And while events like this might look like "patching", they actually contribute to installing that mindset by making everyone in the team aware of the importance of these.</p>

<p>A bootcamp like this has the pleasant side effect of actually proving what we as a team are able to accomplish in a short timeframe. That feeling of speed, and accompanying pride, is a bit harder to find when you're working on bigger, long-term projects that involve lots more nuts and bolts.
Working outside of your comfort zone, by working on features in the code base you haven't seen before, or more literally, by not sitting at your desk, increased team communication and trained new team members.</p>

<p>And of course, you get to learn new stuff about your colleagues after hours. Like how passionate Gheerwijn is about analog cameras.
And that's about all the info you’ll get, because: "what happens at the bootcamp, stays at the bootcamp". Let this vague Polaroid picture of the team be a little testament to that.</p>
